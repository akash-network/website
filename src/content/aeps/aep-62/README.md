## Motivation

Akash providers frequently start out with a small cluster and then expand over time.

## Summary

With Akash Provider Console now generally available and new and existing providers onboarding on to it, we need to add support for a key feature which is the ability to easily add new nodes or remove one or more existing nodes from the cluster.
