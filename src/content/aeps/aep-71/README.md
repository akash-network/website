## Motivation

A users deployment can close becaause of reasons besides running out of funds (which is addressed as part of aep-33). This second type of Alert and Notification lets the user know immediately when a deployment is closed for any reason.

## Summary

Users of Akash Console will have the option of configuring a "Deployment Closed" alert for any deployment within their account and optionally tieing the alert to a notification channel. The initial notification channel supported will be email with more notification channels added over time, based on customer/ user feedback.
