## Motivation

Credit card transactions in USD are converted to USDC to maintain exact balance equivalence, ensuring a smooth user experience. This approach, however, reduces AKT demand, potentially compromising Akash's security. To mitigate this, a protocol-imposed fee (Take Fee) is applied when using USDC for compute payments. AKT stakers determine this fee through governance proposals.

The collected fee is used to purchase AKT from a DEX like Osmosis. A portion of the acquired AKT is burned, while the remainder is earmarked for future staker distribution, as per AKT 2.0 guidelines.

This system offers advantages to all stakeholders:
1. Users benefit from stable, friction-free credit card payments, facilitating adoption among non-crypto users.
2. AKT stakers receive a portion of hosting fees, while AKT undergoes continuous burning with increased usage.
3. The protocol experiences enhanced usage and adoption due to the stable payment option, attracting a broader user base and driving network growth through increased compute purchases.
