## Motivation

Providers need to protect themselves and their company/ brand from being tarnished

## Summary

Akash Provider Console will build tools necessary for providers to be able to prevent workloads and applications that violate their policies from being run on their infrastructure. This will include some combination of a community sourced database of known offensive applications by region that can be modified by providers for their own specific needs along with software and UI elements to configure the provider to check against that database.
