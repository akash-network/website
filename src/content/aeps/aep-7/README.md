## Motivation

As a decentralized system, and the world’s first distributed peer-to-peer open cloud computing marketplace, our aim is to materialize the vision of an open cloud that’s as boundless and free as the sky. To this end, we’re leveraging a series of testnets to gather data, identify critical issues, and ensure our network’s scalability, security, and usability before we launch our mainnet.   
  
These explorations will also enable us to understand our community dynamics and governance, and help us build a healthy and vital community for growth.  
  
## Details
  
To incentivize participants in the Akashian Challenge, we're allocating 3% (3,000,000 AKTs!) of the 100,000,000 tokens that will ever be pre-mined at genesis.   
  
The Akashian Challenge focuses on a series of tasks that get progressively more difficult, and enable participants to explore different aspects of the platform, from performing user operations to node operations.  
  
Our Testnet Beta and Akashian Challenge program is inspired by ecosystem projects from the community, such as Solana Tour de Sol, Cosmos Game of Stakes, and Kava Founder Rewards.  
  
## The Akashian Challenge

The Akashian Challenge will begin on Thursday, April 30th, 2020, and run for 8 weeks in three distinct phases:

**Phase 1: Node Operations**  
**Phase 2: Provider Operations**  
**Phase 3: Developer Operations**  
  
**Phase 1:** The participants earn tokens by solving different challenges related to operating and validating the Akash Blockchain. The challenges will range from setting up Akash node to Governing the network.  
**Phase 2:** Phase 2 involves setting up a secure, production-ready, and scalable Datacenter operation as a provider and/or validator on the Akash network. The goal of this phase is to test various adversarial conditions, identify security loopholes and scalability limits of the Akash network. Beyond setting up the operations, participants are incentivized to stress test the limits of the Akash Network.  
**Phase 3:** Phase 3 incentives developers to build on the Akash network. Developers earn tokens by deploying applications. The most creative applications will be selected every fortnight by committee and public in a live-streamed ceremony.
