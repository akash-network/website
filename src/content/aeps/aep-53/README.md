## Motivation

Users want to be incentivized to provide compute resources to the network.

## Summary

Currently, provider incentives are manually managed. There have been two pilots of this and they have been successful. The plan would be to build the infrastructure necessary to automate this such that a pool of funds is allocated to providers based on type of infrastructure they are providing and after verifying that they provided the resources for the period of time.
