## Motivation

Many users of Akash Console deploy apps and services that need a custom domain. Configuring the mapping from the endpoint (or port mapping) received when the lease is created requires going into a separate UI (like Cloudflare). Allowing this configuration within Console makes UX better

## Summary

Users of Akash Console will have the option of choosing their DNS provider of choice from a set of available options and then configuring custom domain. Console would take care of authenticating the user (via the API credentials for the speicifc DNS provider) and settin the configuration.
