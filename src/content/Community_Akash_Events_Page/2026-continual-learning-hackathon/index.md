description: "Build with the future stack of AI. $50k+ in prizes! We've lined up serious firepower — with integrations and inspiration from You.com, Intercom, Lovable, and Google DeepMind — so your ideas don't just stay ideas. You'll take them all the way to working agents and real products. In just one day, teams will prototype AI copilots, autonomous research agents, customer-support brains, real-time data explorers, and creative design systems—the kind of tools real companies ship. You're not watching the future of intelligent software happen. You're building it."
