This document outlines a collection of guidelines, style suggestions, and tips for writing code used throughout the Akash project.

## Go Standards and Conventions

### Code Submission Requirements

The creators and maintainers of the Go programming language have created standards and policies within this [documentation](https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments).

Akash contributors should become familiar with all standards in this idiomatic Go guide with particular attention focused on topics such as:

* [Go Fmt ](https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments#gofmt)- all code submitted to the Akash code base should have `go fmt` performed prior to submission to ensure proper and conventional formatting
* [Code Comments](https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments#comment-sentences) - all code submitted should be commented throughly and adhere to commenting standards provided in this section
* [Error Handling](https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments#handle-errors) - handle and do not discard errors as described further in this section
* [Variable Names](https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments#variable-names) - const and var naming conventions should follow Go standards as described in this section

## ReactJS and Javascript Conventions

### Code Submission Requirements

While the React project does not maintain or suggest standards for components/variables naming and other considerations, we recommend the use of Airbnb style guides for consistency.

* [JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
