**Programmatic access to Akash Network with blockchain SDKs or credit card REST APIs.**

Choose your integration method:
- **SDK** - Full blockchain integration with AKT/USDC payments
- **Console API** - Simple REST API with credit card payments

---

## SDKs

Build deployment and provider management capabilities directly into your applications:

- **[Akash SDK](/docs/api-documentation/sdk)** - Official Go and JavaScript/TypeScript SDKs
- **[Installation Guide](/docs/api-documentation/sdk/installation)** - Get started with SDK installation
- **[Quick Start](/docs/api-documentation/sdk/quick-start)** - Deploy your first application programmatically
- **[API Reference](/docs/api-documentation/sdk/api-reference)** - Complete SDK documentation
- **[Examples](/docs/api-documentation/sdk/examples)** - Code examples for common tasks

## Console API

Deploy to Akash using credit cards instead of crypto:

- **[Managed Wallet API](/docs/api-documentation/console-api)** - REST API for credit card deployments via Console
- No wallet management required - Console handles the blockchain layer
- Pay with credit card instead of AKT or USDC

---

## Use Cases

### When to Use SDKs
- Full blockchain integration with your own wallet
- Pay with AKT or USDC cryptocurrency

### When to Use Console API
