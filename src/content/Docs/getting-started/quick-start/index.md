3. Read the template description
4. Click **"Deploy Now"**
5. Review the pre-filled configuration
6. Click **"Create Deployment"**

Wait ~1-2 minutes for deployment to complete

2. Read the description: *"A powerful, modular Stable Diffusion tool that lets you build and run advanced image workflows using a visual, node-based interface."*

**Total time:** 1-3 minutes (depending on the template)

You'll see status updates:
- "Creating Deployment..." 
- "Accepting Bid..."
- "Sending Manifest..."
- "Starting Services..."
- **"Running"**

---

## Step 9: Access Your Deployment

Once your deployment shows **"Running"** status:

1. Look for the **"URIs"** or **"Access URLs"** section in your deployment details
2. Click on the URL shown (e.g., `https://your-app.provider.akash.network`)
3. Your web application will open in a new tab!

**Congratulations! You just deployed on Akash Network!**

### What You Can Do Now:

2. Select your service (e.g., `web` or the template name)
3. View real-time logs from your deployment

### Update Your Deployment

To change your deployment configuration:
1. Click on your active deployment
2. Click **"Update Deployment"**
3. Edit the SDL configuration in the editor
4. Click **"Update"** to apply changes

**Note:** Updates modify your existing lease and may briefly interrupt service during the container restart.

When you're done testing:
1. Go to your **"Deployments"** page
2. Find your active deployment
3. Click **"Close Deployment"**

**Always close deployments when you're done to conserve your $100 trial credits.**

## Understanding Your Dashboard

The Console dashboard shows:

- **Trial Status** - Your $100 credit balance, days remaining, and usage
- **Active Deployments** - All your currently running deployments (max 1 day each during trial)
- **Deployment Costs** - Real-time spending from your trial credits
- **Account Balance** - Visual chart showing credit usage (Balance vs Deployments)

**Pro tip:** Hover over your balance at the top to see detailed credit information!

## Common Questions

### "How long do trial deployments last?"
**Answer:** Trial deployments last a maximum of **1 day (24 hours)**. After 24 hours, they will automatically shut down. This is a trial limitation - paid accounts can run indefinitely.

### "What happens after my $100 credits run out?"
**Answer:** Your deployments will stop, but you can add more funds via credit card:
1. Click your balance at the top
2. Click **"Add Funds"**
3. Enter amount and complete payment via Stripe
4. Your unused trial credits will be kept!

### "Can I use my own crypto wallet instead?"
**Answer:** Yes! After creating your trial account, you can also connect a Keplr or Leap wallet for direct blockchain access. This gives you more control and removes the 24-hour deployment limit.

### "My deployment is taking a long time to start"
**Solution:**
- Wait 2-3 minutes - deployment can take time
- Check the status updates in Console
- If stuck for 5+ minutes, close and try a different template
- Some GPU deployments take longer due to high demand

### "I don't see my deployment URL"
**Solution:**
- Wait until status shows **"Running"** (not just "Active")
- Click on your deployment to see details
- Look for **"URIs"** or **"Leases"** section
- The URL will be listed there once the container is fully running

### "Deployment failed to start"
**Solution:**
- If using a custom SDL, check your syntax (indentation, required fields)
- Try using a pre-built template instead (featured templates are most reliable)
- Check the **"Events"** or **"Logs"** tab for error messages
- Contact support on Discord if issue persists

### "$1 verification charge didn't refund yet"
**Answer:** The $1 verification charge typically refunds within 3-7 business days, depending on your bank. This is standard practice for identity verification.
