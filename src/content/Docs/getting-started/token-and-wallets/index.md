## Why Do I Need a Wallet?

When using cryptocurrency, setting up a wallet is crucial to hold and utilize your coins. A wallet, whether software or hardware, allows you to transfer cryptocurrency from an exchange to a usable location. Using your own wallet, as opposed to storing crypto on an exchange, reduces the risk of losing funds due to an exchange hack. Additionally, it enables you to deploy your crypto into Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications like [Osmosis DEX](https://app.osmosis.zone) or stake your funds at higher rates. Exchange wallets are suitable for buying crypto, but non-exchange wallets are better for various other purposes.

## Compatible Wallets in the Cosmos Ecosystem

The Cosmos Ecosystem offers several compatible wallets. Two particularly user-friendly options are [Leap](#leap-cosmos-wallet) and [Keplr](#keplr-wallet). These wallets come pre-installed with support for various networks, including Cosmos, Osmosis, Secret Network, Akash, Crypto.org, Starname, Sifchain, Certik, Irisnet, Regen, Persistence, Sentinel, Kava, Cyber, and Straightedge. Moreover, you can add any Cosmos-based token through a few extra steps. Follow the Leap or Keplr tutorial in this section.

## Developer Tokens

Developers can start experimenting with Akash Deployments within our Sandbox network. The Sandbox allows short-term deployments (may be destroyed after 24 hours of runtime) without spending actual funds to get started.

## Purchasing Akash Tokens

### Decentralized Exchange (DEX)

The easiest way to purchase Akash Tokens ($AKT) is to buy Cosmos tokens ($ATOM) and swap your $ATOM for $AKT using a decentralized exchange (DEX). From there, you can send the ATOM to a Keplr wallet and use [Osmosis](https://app.osmosis.zone/) to convert it into AKT. For currently supported tokens in Osmosis, check the token types in the Osmosis web app.

Funding your network account is required to use the network. All messages charge a transaction fee, and deployment leases are paid by the account used to create them. You can fund your account by buying tokens or applying for awards from the community.

### Centralized Exchange (CEX)

Tokens can be purchased on [exchanges listed here](https://akash.network/token). After purchasing, you can send tokens to your Akash account address.
