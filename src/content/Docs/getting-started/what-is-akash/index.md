**Akash Network is the world's first decentralized cloud computing marketplace.** Think of it as Airbnb for cloud computing—people with spare computing power can rent it out to those who need it.

## In 60 Seconds

Instead of paying AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for servers, you can:
- Deploy your applications on a global network of independent providers
- Save **up to 85%** compared to traditional cloud providers ([compare pricing](https://akash.network/pricing/usage-calculator/))
- Get **censorship-resistant** infrastructure
- Support a **decentralized** internet

**It's real cloud computing, but open, permissionless, and affordable.**

---

## How It Works

### 1. **You Deploy**
Define what resources your app needs in a simple YAML file (CPU, RAM, storage, GPU, and more).

### 2. **Providers Bid**
Independent cloud providers around the world compete to host your application by submitting bids.

### 3. **You Choose**
Pick the best offer based on price, location, and provider reputation.

### 4. **Your App Runs**
Your application runs on the provider's infrastructure. You pay per block, and can close anytime.

## Why Use Akash?

### 💰 **Lower Costs**
Save up to 85% compared to AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. No surprise bills. Pay only for what you use, with resources priced at exact sizes (need 1.36GB RAM? Get exactly that, not just 2GB or 4GB tiers).

### 🌍 **Censorship Resistant**
No single entity can shut down your application. Deploy anywhere, anytime.

### 🚀 **High Performance**
Access to high-end GPUs and compute at fraction of the cost. Perfect for AI/ML workloads.

### 🔓 **Flexible Access**
Start with our **trial** (credit card, $100 free credits, 30 days) or go **permissionless** with your own wallet (no KYC, use AKT or USDC).

**Note:** Trial deployments have a 24-hour maximum duration per deployment, but you can redeploy as many times as you want within your 30-day trial period.

### 🌐 **Global Network**
Providers in 85+ countries. Deploy close to your users for better performance.

## Key Concepts

### Deployment
A **[deployment](/docs/learn/core-concepts/deployments)** is your application definition—what resources you need and how your application should run.

### Provider
A **[provider](/docs/learn/core-concepts/providers-leases)** is an independent cloud operator offering computing resources on Akash.

### Bid
A **[bid](/docs/learn/core-concepts/providers-leases#understanding-bids)** is an offer from a provider to host your deployment at a specific price.

### Lease
A **[lease](/docs/learn/core-concepts/providers-leases#lease-management)** is the active agreement between you and a provider. Once accepted, your deployment runs on their infrastructure.

### SDL
The **[Stack Definition Language (SDL)](/docs/developers/deployment/akash-sdl)** is a YAML format that describes your deployment—similar to Docker Compose.

### AKT
**AKT** is Akash's native cryptocurrency used for payments, staking, and governance.

| **Access** | Credit card + KYC | Credit card (KYC for verification) | No KYC, permissionless |
| **Payment** | Credit card monthly | Credit card | Crypto (AKT or USDC) |
| **Setup** | Complicated | Sign up in 10 minutes | Install wallet, buy AKT |
| **Deployment Limit** | None | 24 hours per deployment | None |
| **Control** | Vendor lock-in | Choose your provider | Full blockchain control |
| **Censorship** | Can be shut down | Censorship-resistant | Censorship-resistant |
