**Akash Network is the world's first decentralized cloud computing marketplace.** Think of it as Airbnb for cloud computing—people with spare computing power can rent it out to those who need it.

## In 60 Seconds

Instead of paying AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for servers, you can:
- Deploy your applications on a global network of independent providers
- Pay **up to 85% less** than traditional cloud providers
- Get **censorship-resistant** infrastructure
- Support a **decentralized** internet

**It's real cloud computing, but open, permissionless, and affordable.**

---

## How It Works

### 1. **You Deploy**
Create a deployment using our CLI, Console, or SDK. Define what you need (CPU, RAM, storage) in a simple YAML file.

### 2. **Providers Bid**
Independent cloud providers around the world compete to host your application by submitting bids.

### 3. **You Choose**
Pick the best offer based on price, location, and provider reputation.

### 4. **Your App Runs**
Your application runs on the provider's infrastructure. You pay per block, and can close anytime.

## Why Use Akash?

### 💰 **Lower Costs**
Pay 3-5x less than AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. No surprise bills. Pay only for what you use.

### 🌍 **Censorship Resistant**
No single entity can shut down your application. Deploy anywhere, anytime.

### 🚀 **High Performance**
Access to high-end GPUs and compute at fraction of the cost. Perfect for AI/ML workloads.

### 🔓 **Flexible Access**
Start with our **trial** (credit card, $100 free) or go **permissionless** with your own wallet (no KYC, use AKT directly).

### 🌐 **Global Network**
Providers in 85+ countries. Deploy close to your users for better performance.

## Key Concepts

### Deployment
A **deployment** is your application definition—what resources you need and how your application should run.

### Provider
A **provider** is an independent cloud operator offering computing resources on Akash.

### Bid
A **bid** is an offer from a provider to host your deployment at a specific price.

### Lease
A **lease** is the active agreement between you and a provider. Once accepted, your deployment runs on their infrastructure.

### SDL
The **Stack Definition Language (SDL)** is a YAML format that describes your deployment—similar to Docker Compose.

### AKT
**AKT** is Akash's native cryptocurrency used for payments, staking, and governance.

## How Akash is Different

| Feature | Traditional Cloud | Akash - Trial | Akash - Wallet |
|---------|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Cost** | High, fixed pricing | $100 free credits | 3-5x cheaper, market-driven |
| **Access** | Credit card + KYC | Credit card (KYC for verification) | No KYC, permissionless |
| **Payment** | Credit card monthly | Credit card | Crypto (AKT) |
| **Setup** | Complicated | Sign up in 10 minutes | Install wallet, buy AKT |
| **Deployment Limit** | None | 24 hours (trial only) | None |
| **Control** | Vendor lock-in | Choose your provider | Full blockchain control |
| **Censorship** | Can be shut down | Censorship-resistant | Censorship-resistant |
