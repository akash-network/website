## How the Trial Works

- **Session Storage:**
  - Your trial wallet and deployment info are stored in your browser's local cache. If you clear your browser cache or use incognito/private mode, your trial deployment and wallet will be **permanently lost**.
- **$10 Credit Cap:**
  - Each trial wallet is preloaded with $10. Once spent, the trial ends.
- **One Trial Per Browser:**
  - You can only use the trial once per browser profile.
- **No Persistence:**
  - Deployments are not persistent. They may be terminated at any time.
- **No Production Use:**
  - This feature is strictly for trial and educational purposes. **Do not use for production workloads.**
- **Expiration:**
  - Trial wallets may expire after a set period or at the discretion of Akash. Check for any alerts in the UI.

> **Warning:**
> There is no way to recover a lost trial deployment or wallet. Use the trial for learning and experimentation only.
