This section explains how to use the **$10 Free Trial** feature on Akash Console. It allows you to test deployments instantly — without a wallet, crypto, or registration.

## What Is Trial Deployment?

The trial deployment lets you test Akash without setting up a wallet or paying with tokens. A temporary wallet is generated in your browser, and **$10 worth of AKT** is credited for you to deploy your first app.

This is ideal for first-time users or developers evaluating the Akash Network.

## How the Trial Flow Works

1. Visit [akash.network](https://akash.network) and click **Console Login** at the top-right.

2. In the Console UI, click the **Start Trial** button located in the top navigation.

3. A temporary wallet will be created in your browser and **$10 in AKT credits** will be automatically applied.

## Cache System and Limitations

Trial deployments rely on **local browser cache**.

- If you **clear cache or switch browsers**, the trial wallet and session will be lost.
- Trials are **not persistent** — once lost, they can't be recovered.
- Only one trial is allowed per browser.
- Trial accounts are not connected to any permanent wallet or login system.

## Trial Restrictions

- This feature is strictly for **educational or testing use** only.
- Trial deployments are **not supported for production**.
- Deployments may be terminated at any time without notice.
- There is **no data persistence**, and sessions may expire without warning.

## Important Notes

- Each browser session gets **$10 in trial AKT**.
- Trial wallet is stored only in-browser and **cannot be exported**.
- There is no time limit, but cache-clearing will end your trial.
- Trial deployments are **non-recoverable**.

## Common Questions

**Can I try again on another device or browser?**  
Yes. Each browser gets one unique trial session.

**Can I use the trial for real apps or production?**  
No. It is only intended for testing and learning purposes.

**Can I save or back up the wallet?**  
No. The temporary wallet exists only in the local browser session.

**What if I close my browser or crash it?**  
Your session may remain intact, but clearing cache, cookies, or using incognito mode will reset your trial.

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable using the trial, [set up a wallet](/docs/getting-started/token-and-wallets/) and fund it with AKT to begin deploying full applications on the Akash Network.
