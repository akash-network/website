#### Before Getting Started

Console is compatible with two wallets as of now, Keplr and Leap wallet. The Keplr or Leap browser extensions must be installed and with sufficient funds (0.5 AKT minimum for a single deployment plus a small amount for transaction fees).

Follow [Keplr Wallet](/docs/getting-started/token-and-wallets/#keplr-wallet) or [Leap Cosmos Wallet](/docs/getting-started/token-and-wallets/#leap-cosmos-wallet) guides to create your first wallet if necessary.

#### Akash Console Access

The Akash Console web app is available via the following URL:

- https://console.akash.network/

### STEP 1 - Connect your Keplr or Leap wallet

#### Conclusion

You have successfully deployed a simple hello world application using Console. Follow similar flow for other deployments, only the SDL file along with docker image and resources is to be configured as per the need.

### Next Steps

For even easier deployments, try the **[GitHub Deploy Feature](/docs/getting-started/github-deploy-feature/)** which allows you to deploy applications directly from GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket repositories without manually building Docker images.
