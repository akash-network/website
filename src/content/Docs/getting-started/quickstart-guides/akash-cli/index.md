#### Before Getting Started

You must have Akash CLI installed and properly configured along with some AKTs in your wallet(0.5 AKT minimum for a single deployment plus a small amount for transaction fees).

Follow [CLI Installation Guide](/docs/deployments/akash-cli/installation/#install-akash-cli) to install the Akash CLI if necessary.

### Check your Account Balance

Check your account has sufficient balance by running:

```bash
provider-services query bank balances --node $AKASH_NODE $AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
```

You should see a response similar to:

```
balances:
- amount: "93000637"
  denom: uakt
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

If you don't have a balance, please see the [funding guide](/docs/deployments/akash-cli/installation/#fund-your-account). Please note the balance indicated is denominated in uAKT (AKT x 10^-6), in the above example, the account has a balance of _93 AKT_. We're now setup to deploy.

**Note:** Your account must have a minimum balance of 0.5 AKT to create a deployment. This 0.5 AKT funds the escrow account associated with the deployment and is used to pay the provider for their services. It is recommended you have more than this minimum balance to pay for transaction fees. For more information on escrow accounts, see [here](/docs/getting-started/intro-to-akash/payments/#escrow-accounts)


## STEP 1:- Create your Configuration

Create a deployment configuration [deploy.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxmaxlabs/hello-akash-world/master/deploy.yml) to deploy the `akashlytics/hello-akash-world:0.2.0` for [hello-akash-world](https://github.com/maxmaxlabs/hello-akash-world) which is a simple Next.JS "Hello World" application.

You can use CURL command to download the SDL file:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxmaxlabs/hello-akash-world/master/deploy.yml > deploy.yml
```

The SDL file is the configuration file specifying all the needed resources like cpu, ram, storage etc. Since, this is a simple "Hello World" application so the needed resources will be very less.

## STEP 2:- Setup your Client Certificate

Generate and publish a certificate. A certificate will be required to authenticate clients to providers.

### Generating the Certificate

Run the following command:

```bash
provider-services tx cert generate client --from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

Incase an error like the following is shown, then the certificate already exists: `Error: certificate error: cannot overwrite certificate`.
If you want to replace it, add the `--overwrite` option.

### Publishing the Certificate

Once the certificate is generated locally, it can be published to the blockchain
with the following command:

```bash
provider-services tx cert publish client --from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```


## STEP 3:- Create your Deployment

To deploy the sdl file that we curled in the previous step, run following command:

```bash
provider-services tx deployment create deploy.yml --from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

You should see a response similar to:

}
```

### Find your Deployment 

Find the Deployment Sequence (**DSEQ**) in the deployment you just created. For example, in the current deployment the dseq value is 140324, which you can confirm in the response above.

Then run the following command, make sure to copy paste the DSEQ value from your deployment:

```bash
export AKASH_DSEQ=CHANGETHIS
```

Now set the Order Sequence (OSEQ) and Group Sequence (GSEQ). Note that if this is your first time deploying on Akash, OSEQ and GSEQ will be 1.

```bash
AKASH_OSEQ=1
AKASH_GSEQ=1
```

Verify we have the right values populated by running:

```bash
echo $AKASH_DSEQ $AKASH_OSEQ $AKASH_GSEQ
```

## STEP 4:- View your Bids and choose a provider

After a short time, you should see bids from providers for this deployment with the following command:

```bash
provider-services query market bid list --owner=$AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS --node $AKASH_NODE --dseq $AKASH_DSEQ --state=open
```

### Choose a Provider

Note that there are bids from multiple different providers. In this case, both providers happen to be willing to accept a price of _1 uAKT_. This means that the lease can be created using _1 uAKT_ or _0.000001 AKT_ per block to execute the container. You should see a response similar to:

```
bids:
- bid:
    bid_id:
      dseq: "140324"
      gseq: 1
      oseq: 1
      owner: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj
      provider: akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
    created_at: "140326"
    price:
      amount: "1"
      denom: uakt
    state: open
  escrow_account:
    balance:
      amount: "50000000"
      denom: uakt
    id:
      scope: bid
      xid: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj/140324/1/1/akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
    owner: akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
    settled_at: "140326"
    state: open
    transferred:
      amount: "0"
      denom: uakt
- bid:
    bid_id:
      dseq: "140324"
      gseq: 1
      oseq: 1
      owner: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj
      provider: akash1f6gmtjpx4r8qda9nxjwq26fp5mcjyqmaq5m6j7
    created_at: "140326"
    price:
      amount: "1"
      denom: uakt
    state: open
  escrow_account:
    balance:
      amount: "50000000"
      denom: uakt
    id:
      scope: bid
      xid: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj/140324/1/1/akash1f6gmtjpx4r8qda9nxjwq26fp5mcjyqmaq5m6j7
    owner: akash1f6gmtjpx4r8qda9nxjwq26fp5mcjyqmaq5m6j7
    settled_at: "140326"
    state: open
    transferred:
      amount: "0"
      denom: uakt
```

For this example, we will choose provider `akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal`. Run following command to set the provider shell variable:

```
AKASH_PROVIDER=akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
```

Verify we have the right value populated by running:

```
echo $AKASH_PROVIDER
```

## STEP 5:- Create and confirm a Lease

Create a lease for the bid from the chosen provider above by running this command:

```
provider-services tx market lease create --dseq $AKASH_DSEQ --provider $AKASH_PROVIDER --from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

### Confirm the Lease

You can check the status of your lease by running:

```
provider-services query market lease list --owner $AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS --node $AKASH_NODE --dseq $AKASH_DSEQ
```

Note the bids will close automatically after 5 minutes, and you may get the response:

```
bid not open
```

If this happens, close your deployment and open a new deployment again. To close your deployment run this command:

```
provider-services tx deployment close --dseq $AKASH_DSEQ  --owner $AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS --from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

If your lease was successful you should see a response that ends with:

```
    state: active
```

**Note:** Please note that once the lease is created, the provider will begin debiting your deployment's escrow account, even if you have not completed the deployment process by uploading the manifest in the following step.

## Send the Manifest

Upload the manifest using the values from above step:

```
provider-services send-manifest deploy.yml --dseq $AKASH_DSEQ --provider $AKASH_PROVIDER --from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

### Confirm the URL

Now that the manifest is uploaded, your image is deployed. You can retrieve the access details by running the following command:

```
provider-services lease-status --dseq $AKASH_DSEQ --from $AKASH_KEY_NAME --provider $AKASH_PROVIDER
```

You should see a response similar to:

```javascript
{
  "services": {
    "web": {
      "name": "web",
      "available": 1,
      "total": 1,
      "uris": [
        "rga3h05jetf9h3p6dbk62m19ck.ingress.ewr1p0.mainnet.akashian.io"
      ],
      "observed_generation": 1,
      "replicas": 1,
      "updated_replicas": 1,
      "ready_replicas": 1,
      "available_replicas": 1
    }
  },
  "forwarded_ports": {}
}
```

You can access the application by visiting the hostnames mapped to your deployment. Look for a URL/URI and copy it to your web browser.

Then you should be able to see the landing page of the "Hello World" Application"

![HelloWorld](./12.png)

### View your logs

You can view your application logs to debug issues or watch progress like so:

```bash
provider-services lease-logs \
  --dseq "$AKASH_DSEQ" \
  --provider "$AKASH_PROVIDER" \
  --from "$AKASH_KEY_NAME"
```

## STEP 6:- Close Deployment

### Close the Deployment

Now, since we have learned how to deploy the 'Hello World' application, we will close the deployment in order to not waste any AKTs. After closing the deployment we will get the remaing balance left as a refund. 

Run following command to close the deployment:

```
provider-services tx deployment close --from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

## Conclusion

We deployed a simple "Hello World" Next.JS application within 5 minutes. The process of deploying any other applications is identical, just the sdl file needs to be changed accordingly with proper configuration and container image.
