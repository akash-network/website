## Payment Options on Akash

### 1. Decentralized Wallet (AKT Token)

Ideal for users seeking maximum control, privacy, and the advantages of decentralized finance. Connect your preferred crypto wallet—such as Keplr, Cosmostation, or Leap—to the Akash Console to pay for deployments directly with AKT tokens. If you are new to crypto wallets or AKT, refer to our [Token & Wallets guide](../token-and-wallets/) for comprehensive instructions on creating, funding, and connecting your wallet. Key benefits include maintaining full custody of your funds, benefiting from instant payments, and transacting without intermediaries.

### 2. Credit/Debit Card, Bank Transfer, and Alternative Methods

Best for users who prefer the convenience of traditional payment methods and do not wish to manage cryptocurrencies. Add a payment method—Visa, Mastercard, bank transfer, Amazon Pay, Cash App, and more—directly in the Console. Your account will be credited in USD, with Akash automatically handling the conversion to AKT. No wallet is required, so you can deploy and pay for services without interacting with cryptocurrencies. All new users receive $10 in complimentary trial credits—no card or wallet required to get started.

## Redeeming Coupons & Promo Codes

If you have a promo, referral, or trial code, after step 13, enter it in the Coupon Code box under "Add credits" on the Payment Methods page, then click Claim coupon. The coupon amount will be discounted from your total, and you pay the remaining balance if any.

## How Credits Work

- Trial credits ($10 free) are for new users and may have some limits (e.g., only for first deployments).
- Promo/referral codes may have expiration dates or minimum spend requirements.
- Credits are for Akash services only—they can’t be withdrawn as cash.
- You can always see your current balance at the top of the Console.
- Akash automatically converts your USD (or USDC) payments to AKT in the background, so you don’t need to manage crypto or worry about conversion.
- Akash uses Stripe to securely process payments from cards, bank transfers, and other supported methods.

## Troubleshooting & Support

Email Verification Required:
- You must verify your email before adding funds. If you missed the email, click Resend verification email in the Console.

Invalid Coupon:
- Double-check for typos, expiration, or if the code was already used.

Payment Failed:
- Make sure your payment method is valid and has enough funds. Try a different method if needed.

Wallet Issues:
