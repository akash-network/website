## Payment Options on Akash


### 1. Decentralized Wallet (AKT Token)

- **Ideal for:** Users seeking maximum control, privacy, and the advantages of decentralized finance.
- **Overview:** Connect your preferred crypto wallet (such as Keplr, Cosmostation, or Leap) to the Akash Console to pay for deployments directly with AKT tokens.
- **Getting Started:** If you are new to crypto wallets or AKT, refer to our [Token & Wallets guide](../token-and-wallets/) for comprehensive instructions on creating, funding, and connecting your wallet.
- **Key Benefits:** Maintain full custody of your funds, benefit from instant payments, and transact without intermediaries.

### 2. Credit/Debit Card, Bank Transfer, and Alternative Methods

- **Ideal for:** Users who prefer the convenience of traditional payment methods and do not wish to manage cryptocurrencies.
- **Overview:** Add a payment method (Visa, Mastercard, bank transfer, Amazon Pay, Cash App, etc.) directly in the Console. Your account will be credited in USD, with Akash automatically handling the conversion to AKT.
- **No Wallet Required:** Deploy and pay for services without interacting with cryptocurrencies.
- **Trial Credits:** All new users receive $10 in complimentary trial credits—no card or wallet required to get started.
