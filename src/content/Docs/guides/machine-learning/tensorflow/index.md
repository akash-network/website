This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy TensorFlow on the Akash Network using its official Docker image. The Akash Network is a decentralized cloud computing marketplace, ideal for running AI/ML workloads in a cost-effective and scalable manner.

## **Overview of TensorFlow on Akash**

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning platform used for building and deploying ML models. Running TensorFlow on Akash leverages the decentralized cloud to:
- Reduce infrastructure costs.
- Enable scalable, distributed training and inference.
- Avoid dependency on centralized cloud providers.

Akash provides GPU and CPU instances to handle TensorFlow workloads, making it ideal for AI/ML applications.

## **Prerequisites**
1. **Install Akash CLI:** Ensure you have the Akash CLI installed and configured. Refer to the [Akash documentation](/docs/getting-started/quickstart-guides/akash-cli/) for setup instructions.
2. **Akash Tokens:** Acquire Akash tokens (AKT) to pay for compute resources.
3. **Dockerized TensorFlow:** Use the official TensorFlow Docker image from Docker Hub.
4. **Domain Configuration (Optional):** If you want to expose the service via a domain, configure DNS appropriately.

## **Step-by-Step Guide**

### **1. Prepare the SDL File**
The SDL (Stack Definition Language) file defines the deployment configuration for Akash. Below is an example for TensorFlow:

```
version: "2.0"

services:
  tensorflow-service:
    image: tensorflow/tensorflow:latest  # Official TensorFlow Docker image
    expose:
      - port: 8501  # TensorFlow Serving default port
        as: 80
        to:
          - global

profiles:
  compute:
    tensorflow-profile:
      resources:
        cpu:
          units: 1  # Adjust according to your workload
        memory:
          size: 2Gi  # Adjust memory size
        storage:
          size: 5Gi  # Persistent storage size for model files

  placement:
    tensorflow-deployment:
      attributes:
        region: us-west  # Specify the region
      signedBy:
        anyOf:
          - akash.network
      pricing:
        tensorflow-profile:
          denom: uakt
          amount: 500  # Set the bid price (in uAKT)

deployment:
  tensorflow-deployment:
    tensorflow-profile:
      count: 1
```

---

### **2. Deploy to Akash**
1. **Initialize Deployment:**
   ```
   provider-services tx deployment create deploy.yaml --from <wallet-name> --chain-id <chain-id> --node <node-address>
   ```

2. **Bid and Accept Lease:**
   After submitting the deployment, monitor the bid and accept the lease once a provider is found:
   ```
   provider-services query market bid list
   provider-services tx market lease create --dseq <deployment-seq> --gseq <group-seq> --oseq <order-seq> --provider <provider-address> --from <wallet-name>
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment:**
   Check the status of your deployment:
   ```
   provider-services query deployment get --dseq <deployment-seq>
   ```

---

### **3. Access TensorFlow Service**
- Once the deployment is active, note the provider's IP address or hostname.
- Access TensorFlow Serving using the specified port (default is `8501`).

For example:
```
curl http://<provider-ip>:80/v1/models/my_model:predict -d '{"instances": [[1.0, 2.0, 5.0]]}'
```

---

## **Best Practices**
1. **Resource Scaling:** Optimize `cpu` and `memory` values based on your workload. Use higher resources for training or complex models.
2. **Persistent Storage:** Configure storage volumes if your TensorFlow models require saving/loading data frequently.
3. **Security:** Secure API endpoints with appropriate authentication methods.
4. **Monitoring:** Integrate logs and monitoring tools to track service performance.

---

## **Example Use Cases**
- **Model Training:** Leverage Akash for cost-effective distributed training.
- **Inference Service:** Deploy TensorFlow Serving to handle ML inference requests.
- **Research:** Utilize decentralized infrastructure for ML experiments.

---

## **Conclusion**
By deploying TensorFlow on Akash, you gain access to affordable, decentralized cloud resources while maintaining high performance and scalability. Follow this guide to deploy your TensorFlow workloads seamlessly on Akash.
