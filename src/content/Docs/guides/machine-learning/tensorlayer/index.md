This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy **TensorLayer** on the Akash Network using the official Docker image. TensorLayer is a versatile deep learning library built on top of TensorFlow. With Akash, you can deploy and run TensorLayer workloads in a decentralized and cost-effective manner.

---

## **Prerequisites**
1. **Install Akash CLI**  
   Ensure you have the Akash CLI installed and configured. Follow the official guide to set up your Akash environment:  
   [Akash CLI Documentation](/docs/deployments/overview/).

2. **Akash Account**  
   Ensure you have an Akash wallet funded with sufficient AKT tokens.

3. **Docker Image**  
   We will use the official TensorLayer Docker image:  
   ```
   docker pull tensorlayer/tensorlayer
   ```

4. **Create an SDL File**  
   SDL (Stack Definition Language) is used to describe your deployment configuration on Akash.

## **Steps to Deploy TensorLayer on Akash**

### **1. Create an SDL Template**
Create a file called `deploy.yaml` and define your deployment parameters. Below is an example configuration:

```
---
version: "2.0"

services:
  tensorlayer-service:
    image: tensorlayer/tensorlayer:latest
    expose:
      - port: 8888
        as: 8888
        to:
          - global: true
    env:
      - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
    args:
      - "python3"
      - "-m"
      - "tensorlayer"
    resources:
      cpu:
        units: 1
      memory:
        size: 512Mi
      storage:
        size: 1Gi

profiles:
  compute:
    tensorlayer-profile:
      match:
        attributes:
          region: us-west
      resources:
        cpu:
          units: 1
        memory:
          size: 512Mi
        storage:
          size: 1Gi

  placement:
    global-placement:
      pricing:
        tensorlayer-profile:
          denom: uakt
          amount: 100

deployment:
  tensorlayer-deployment:
    tensorlayer-profile:
      - global-placement
```

### **2. Deploy the SDL File**
Run the following commands to deploy the SDL file to Akash:

```
# Create a deployment
provider-services tx deployment create deploy.yaml --from <wallet-name> --node https://rpc.akash.network:26657 --chain-id akashnet-2

# Confirm deployment
provider-servicesquery deployment list --owner <wallet-address> --node https://rpc.akash.network:26657
```

### **3. Check the Deployment Status**
Use the following command to check the status of your deployment:

```
provider-services query deployment get <deployment-id> --node https://rpc.akash.network:26657
```

### **4. Access the TensorLayer Service**
Once the deployment is successfully running, Akash will provide a public IP address and port. Access TensorLayer via the browser or a tool like `curl`:

```
http://<public-ip>:8888
```

## **Overflow of the Product**
1. **Use Case**: TensorLayer is perfect for building and training AI models in a decentralized environment. Akash allows you to scale computation resources cost-effectively.
   
2. **Product Flow**:
   - **TensorLayer Setup**: TensorLayer runs on the containerized infrastructure provided by Akash.
   - **Environment Configurations**: Customize the Docker container by injecting environment variables, Python scripts, or Jupyter notebooks for your AI workflows.
   - **AI Model Deployment**: Deploy AI models directly on TensorLayer and make them accessible through Akash's globally distributed nodes.

3. **Advantages**:
   - Decentralized infrastructure reduces costs compared to traditional cloud providers.
   - High availability across Akashâ€™s distributed network.
   - Fully customizable deployment using Docker and SDL.

4. **Potential Use Cases**:
   - Model training and inference for natural language processing, image recognition, or predictive analytics.
   - Decentralized AI services for applications like chatbots, recommendation systems, and real-time analytics.

---

## **Additional Notes**
- For advanced deployments, integrate persistent storage for large datasets.
- Monitor resource usage using Akash's metrics and update your deployment profile as needed.

With this guide, you can deploy TensorLayer on Akash and leverage its decentralized infrastructure for cost-efficient AI workloads.
