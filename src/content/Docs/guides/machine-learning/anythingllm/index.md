**AnythingLLM** is an open-source solution designed to enhance productivity by offering fine-tuned language models tailored to specific tasks or datasets. By hosting and running your own instance of AnythingLLM, you can utilize its capabilities for natural language processing (NLP) tasks like text summarization, question answering, or generating context-aware responses.

- **Features:**
  - User-friendly API for language model interaction.
  - Fine-tuning capabilities for specific datasets.
  - Flexible deployment on various platforms.

**Akash Network** is a decentralized cloud computing platform that provides an affordable, efficient, and censorship-resistant environment to host applications like AnythingLLM.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install Akash CLI**:
   - Download and install the [Akash CLI](http://localhost:4321/docs/getting-started/quickstart-guides/akash-cli/).
2. **Set Up Your Wallet**:
   - Create a wallet and fund it with AKT tokens.
   - Follow the [wallet setup guide](/docs/getting-started/token-and-wallets/).
3. **Akash Deployment Account**:
   - Ensure you have a deployment account set up with the Akash CLI.
4. **Docker Image**:
   - We will use the Docker image `mintplexlabs/anythingllm` for deployment.

## Sample SDL for Deploying AnythingLLM on Akash

Below is a sample Service Descriptor Language (SDL) file that you can use to deploy AnythingLLM on Akash.

```yaml
---
version: "2.0"

services:
  anythingllm:
    image: mintplexlabs/anythingllm:latest
    expose:
      - port: 5000
        as: 80
        to:
          - global: true

profiles:
  compute:
    anythingllm:
      resources:
        cpu:
          units: 500m
        memory:
          size: 1Gi
        storage:
          size: 5Gi

  placement:
    akash:
      pricing:
        anythingllm: 
          denom: uakt
          amount: 100

deployment:
  anythingllm:
    akash:
      profile: anythingllm
      count: 1
```

## Steps to Deploy AnythingLLM on Akash

1. **Prepare the SDL File**:
   - Save the above SDL file as `deploy.yaml`.

2. **Validate the SDL**:
   Run the following command to validate your SDL file:
   ```bash
   provider-services tx deployment validate deploy.yaml
   ```

3. **Create the Deployment**:
   Submit the SDL file to the Akash network to create a deployment:
   ```bash
   provider-services tx deployment create anythingllm.yaml --from <your-wallet-name>
   ```

4. **Bid on a Provider**:
   After creating the deployment, providers will bid to host it. Accept a suitable bid:
   ```bash
   provider-services query market lease list --owner <your-deployment-address>
   provider-services tx market lease create --owner <your-deployment-address> --dseq <deployment-sequence> --gseq <group-sequence> --oseq <order-sequence> --from <your-wallet-name>
   ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   - Once the deployment is live, you can access AnythingLLM at the URL provided by your Akash provider.
   - Ensure the application is reachable on the global port (80 as specified in the SDL).

6. **Monitor Logs**:
   View logs to ensure the service is running correctly:
   ```bash
   provider-services provider lease logs --dseq <deployment-sequence> --gseq <group-sequence> --oseq <order-sequence>
   ```

---

## Additional Configuration (Optional)
- **Environment Variables**: Customize AnythingLLM by passing environment variables in the `services` section of the SDL.
- **Storage**: Increase storage if your datasets are large.

## Conclusion
By following this guide, you can successfully deploy AnythingLLM on Akash. This deployment leverages Akash's decentralized infrastructure to host your NLP service affordably and securely.
