## Introduction to GNU Octave

GNU Octave is an open-source, high-level programming language primarily used for numerical computations. It provides a convenient command-line interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically and is highly compatible with MATLAB. GNU Octave is extensively used in scientific research, engineering, data analysis, and machine learning for its capabilities in matrix operations, algorithm development, and data visualization.

### Features of GNU Octave:
- **Matrix Manipulation**: Handle large-scale matrix computations.
- **Optimization**: Perform optimization using built-in or third-party packages.
- **Simulation**: Create simulations for scientific and engineering processes.
- **Toolboxes**: Compatible with toolboxes for specialized functionality, such as MATPOWER for power system simulations.

In this guide, weâ€™ll deploy **GNU Octave** on the **Akash Network** using the `matpower/octave` Docker image, which provides a complete GNU Octave environment with optimization packages like IPOPT, OSQP, SeDuMi, and SDPT3.

## Prerequisites

1. **Akash CLI Installed**: Ensure you have the Akash CLI installed and configured. Refer to the [Akash Documentation](/docs/deployments/akash-cli/overview/) for setup instructions.
2. **AKT Tokens**: Ensure you have AKT tokens in your wallet for deployment.
3. **Account Setup**: Your Akash account should be set up and ready to deploy workloads.

## Steps to Deploy GNU Octave on Akash

### 1. **Prepare the Deployment YAML**

Below is an example of the deployment YAML file for running GNU Octave on Akash. This will deploy the `matpower/octave` Docker image.

```
---
version: "2.0"

services:
  octave:
    image: matpower/octave
    expose:
      - port: 8080
        as: 80
        to:
          - global: true

profiles:
  compute:
    octave:
      resources:
        cpu:
          units: 500m
        memory:
          size: 512Mi
        storage:
          size: 1Gi

  placement:
    akash:
      attributes:
        host: akash
      pricing:
        octave:
          denom: uakt
          amount: 1000

deployment:
  octave:
    profile:
      compute: octave
      placement: akash
    count: 1
```

### 2. **Deploy Using Akash CLI**

1. Save the above YAML configuration to a file, e.g., `deploy.yaml`.
2. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
provider-services tx deployment create deploy.yaml --from <your-wallet-name> --chain-id <akash-chain-id>
```

Replace `<your-wallet-name>` and `<akash-chain-id>` with your Akash wallet name and chain ID.

3. After the deployment is submitted, check the status:

```bash
provider-services query market lease list --owner <your-wallet-address>
```

4. Once the lease is established, retrieve the access URL for your deployment:

```bash
provider-services provider lease-status --dseq <deployment-sequence-id> --owner <your-wallet-address>
```

### 3. **Access GNU Octave**

After deployment, the `matpower/octave` environment will be accessible via the assigned IP or domain at the specified port (default: 80).

### 4. **Run GNU Octave Commands**

Access the container to use GNU Octave directly:

1. SSH into the running container (using the provider-assigned access).
2. Launch the Octave CLI by executing:

```bash
octave
```

Alternatively, modify the deployment to include a persistent storage volume if you wish to save your computations or scripts.

---

## Advanced Configuration

- **Add Persistent Storage**: Update the YAML to include persistent storage to save scripts and data.
- **Scaling**: Adjust the `count` parameter in the `deployment` section to scale your environment.
- **Expose Additional Ports**: Modify the `expose` section to open other ports for services like a web interface.

## Conclusion

This deployment guide helps you run a complete GNU Octave environment on Akash Network using the `matpower/octave` image. By leveraging Akash's decentralized cloud, you can take advantage of low-cost, scalable computing for your numerical and scientific needs.
