This guide will walk you through deploying a V2Ray instance on Akash. V2Ray is a popular VPN software used to help users bypass network restrictions and enhance security.

### Prerequisites

Before deploying V2Ray, make sure you have the following tools installed:
- [Akash CLI](/docs/deployments/akash-cli/installation/#install-akash-cli) (v0.21.0 or newer)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [V2Ray Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/v2ray/official)

You also need an active Akash account, and some tokens in your wallet.

### Steps to Deploy V2Ray

#### 1. Set up the Akash CLI

If you haven’t already configured Akash CLI, run the following command to set up your environment.

```bash
provider-services init
```

This will set the default configuration and prompt you for the details, such as your wallet address.

#### 2. Prepare V2Ray Docker Container

Create a `deploy.yml` file to set up your V2Ray container. For simplicity, we will use an official V2Ray Docker image.

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  v2ray:
    image: v2ray/official
    container_name: v2ray
    ports:
      - "1080:1080"  # Local SOCKS5 proxy
      - "8080:8080"  # HTTP Proxy
    environment:
      - V2RAY_VMESS_AEAD_FORCED=false
      - V2RAY_LOGLEVEL=warning
    restart: always
```

#### 3. Deploy V2Ray to Akash

You can now deploy V2Ray to Akash using the `provider-services` command. 

- First, you’ll need to prepare your deployment manifest. Below is a simple template for the manifest:

```yaml
services:
  v2ray:
    image: v2ray/official
    expose:
      - "1080:1080"
      - "8080:8080"
    env:
      - V2RAY_VMESS_AEAD_FORCED=false
      - V2RAY_LOGLEVEL=warning
    resources:
      cpu: 0.5
      memory: 1Gi
      storage: 10Gi
```

Now deploy this to Akash using the new command structure:

```bash
provider-services deploy --manifest ./path-to-your-manifest.yaml
```

This will begin the deployment process. The command will communicate with the Akash provider to launch a node with the V2Ray container.

#### 4. Monitor the Deployment

Once deployed, you can check the status of your V2Ray instance by running:

```bash
provider-services status
```

You should see your V2Ray container running, along with any other details (e.g., IP address, service status).

#### 5. Connect to V2Ray

Once your V2Ray instance is live, you can connect to it using the IP address provided by Akash. Simply configure your V2Ray client to use the following details:
- **Server address**: [Your Akash Instance IP]
- **Port**: 1080 (for SOCKS5) or 8080 (for HTTP proxy)

### Cleaning Up

After you're done with your V2Ray instance, make sure to delete the deployment to avoid ongoing charges.

```bash
provider-services delete --service v2ray
```

### Conclusion

You've successfully deployed V2Ray on Akash using the `provider-services` command! This approach makes it easy to get your VPN up and running with Akash's decentralized cloud infrastructure.
