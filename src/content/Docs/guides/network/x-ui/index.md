Here's a step-by-step guide on how to deploy **X-UI** on Akash.

### Steps to Deploy **X-UI** on Akash

1. **Set Up Akash CLI**

   First, make sure you have the latest version of the Akash CLI installed. You can install or update the Akash CLI by following the official installation instructions from the [Akash Docs](https://akash.network/docs).

   ```bash
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ovrclk/akash/master/tools/install.sh | bash
   ```

   This will install the latest version of the Akash CLI on your machine.

2. **Create a New Provider Services Account**

   You'll need a provider-services account to interact with the Akash network:

   ```bash
   provider-services init
   ```

   This command initializes your `provider-services` configuration, including API keys and other necessary credentials.

3. **Set Up Your Akash Wallet**

   Ensure that your Akash wallet is set up with sufficient tokens for deploying services:

   ```bash
   provider-services keys add my-wallet
   ```

   Make sure to fund your wallet with tokens, as you'll need them for deploying services.

4. **Prepare X-UI Deployment Files**

   You'll need to prepare the necessary deployment files for **X-UI**. Here’s a basic example of what the deployment configuration files might look like.

   - **deployment.yml**: This file contains the deployment specifications for the X-UI application.
   

   Example **deployment.yml** file:

   ```yaml
   version: "2.0"
   services:
     x-ui:
       image: your_docker_image
       expose:
         - port: 80
       resources:
         cpu:
           units: 1
         memory:
           size: 2Gi
         storage:
           size: 10Gi
   ```

   Replace `your_docker_image` with the actual Docker image for **X-UI** that you wish to deploy.

5. **Deploy the Application Using `provider-services`**

   Now you can deploy the **X-UI** app to Akash using the `provider-services` command. Run the following command to deploy your app:

   ```bash
   provider-services deploy --file deployment.yml
   ```

   This will push the configuration to the Akash network and start the deployment of **X-UI**.

6. **Monitor the Deployment**

   After deploying, you can monitor the status of your deployment using the following command:

   ```bash
   provider-services status
   ```

   This will show the current status of your deployed services.

7. **Access Your X-UI Service**

   Once your **X-UI** service is deployed, it will be assigned a public IP or DNS name. You can retrieve this information using:

   ```bash
   provider-services info
   ```

   This command will give you the details of your deployed **X-UI** app, including the IP address or DNS for access.

8. **Clean Up Resources**

   If you wish to tear down your deployment, use the following command:

   ```bash
   provider-services remove --service x-ui
   ```

   This will remove the service from the Akash network.

### Final Notes

- Ensure your **X-UI** Docker image is publicly available, or host it in a container registry like Docker Hub.
- Make sure you have enough funds in your Akash wallet to cover the deployment.
- For more advanced configurations or troubleshooting, consult the [Akash Documentation](https://akash.network/docs).
