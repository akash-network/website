Building and deploying a React application to Akash, a decentralized cloud computing marketplace, involves several steps. I'll guide you through the process of creating a React app, packaging it for deployment, and deploying it using both the Akash CLI and the Akash Console. This guide will include a sample SDL (Service Definition Language) file that you can use for your deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed to build your React app.
- **Akash CLI** installed. You can find installation instructions on the [Akash documentation](/docs/getting-started/quickstart-guides/akash-cli/).
- Akash Wallet with sufficient funds to deploy your application.
- A basic understanding of [Docker](https://docker.com/), as Akash deploys applications using Docker containers.

## Step 1: Create a React Application

If you haven't already created a React application, you can do so with the following commands:

```
npx create-react-app my-react-app
cd my-react-app
npm run build
```

This will create a production build of your React app in the `build` directory.

## Step 2: Dockerize Your React Application

To deploy your React app on Akash, you need to containerize it using Docker.

### 1. Create a Dockerfile in the root of your React project:

```
# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
FROM node:16-alpine as build

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the container
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the container
COPY . .

# Build the React app
RUN npm run build

# Use an official Nginx image to serve the build
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build files to the Nginx html directory
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### 2. Build the Docker image:
 
 ```
 docker build -t my-react-app .
```

### 3. Test the Docker image locally:

```
docker run -p 8080:80 my-react-app
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to see your React app running.

## Step 3: Prepare the SDL File for Deployment

To deploy your React app on Akash, you need to define an SDL file that describes your deployment. Here’s a sample SDL file (`deploy.yaml`):

```
---
version: "2.0"

services:
  web:
    image: your-dockerhub-username/my-react-app:latest
    expose:
      - port: 80
        as: 80
        to:
          - global: true

profiles:
  compute:
    web:
      resources:
        cpu:
          units: 1
        memory:
          size: 512Mi
        storage:
          size: 1Gi
  placement:
    westcoast:
      attributes:
        region: us-west
      signedBy:
        anyOf:
          - akash1d4a58trjpqwyt2zj63w9uqwpphzxlz7v75d3t0
      pricing:
        web:
          denom: uakt
          amount: 100

deployment:
  web:
    westcoast:
      profile: web
      count: 1
```

## Step 4: Deploying Using Akash CLI

- Create your Certificate

Akash requires an account to have a valid certificate associated with it to start participating in the deployment process. In this section of the guide, we will create a certificate locally, and then proceed to store this certificate on the Akash blockchain. To do this, ensure you have followed all the steps outlined in this guide up to this point. Additionally, these transactions must be executed from an Akash account in possession of some $AKT tokens.

Once an account has a certificate associated with it, it can begin deploying services on the Akash blockchain. **A certificate needs to be created only once per account. After creation, it can be used across any number of deployments for as long as it remains valid.**


```
provider-services tx cert generate client -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Publish Cert to the Blockchain

```
provider-services tx cert publish client -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Create your Deployment

- CPU Support

Only x86_64 processors are officially supported for Akash deployments. This may change in the future and when ARM processors are supported it will be announced and documented.

- Akash Deployment

> _**NOTE**_ - if your current terminal session has been used to create prior deployments, issue the command `unset AKASH_DSEQ` to prevent receipt of error message `Deployment Exists`

To deploy on Akash, run:

```
provider-services tx deployment create deploy.yaml -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

You should see a response similar to:

- Find your Deployment \-

Find the Deployment Sequence (DSEQ) in the deployment you just created. You will need to replace the AKASH_DSEQ with the number from your deployment to configure a shell variable.

```bash
export AKASH_DSEQ=CHANGETHIS
```

Now set the Order Sequence (OSEQ) and Group Sequence (GSEQ). Note that if this is your first time deploying on Akash, OSEQ and GSEQ will be 1.

```bash
AKASH_OSEQ=1
AKASH_GSEQ=1
```

Verify we have the right values populated by running:

```bash
echo $AKASH_DSEQ $AKASH_OSEQ $AKASH_GSEQ
```

- View your Bids

After a short time, you should see bids from providers for this deployment with the following command:

```bash
provider-services query market bid list -owner=$AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS -node $AKASH_NODE -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -state=open
```

- Choose a Provider

Note that there are bids from multiple different providers. In this case, both providers happen to be willing to accept a price of _1 uAKT_. This means that the lease can be created using _1 uAKT_ or _0.000001 AKT_ per block to execute the container. You should see a response similar to:

```
bids:
- bid:
    bid_id:
      dseq: "140324"
      gseq: 1
      oseq: 1
      owner: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj
      provider: akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
    created_at: "140326"
    price:
      amount: "1"
      denom: uakt
    state: open
  escrow_account:
    balance:
      amount: "50000000"
      denom: uakt
    id:
      scope: bid
      xid: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj/140324/1/1/akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
    owner: akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
    settled_at: "140326"
    state: open
    transferred:
      amount: "0"
      denom: uakt
- bid:
    bid_id:
      dseq: "140324"
      gseq: 1
      oseq: 1
      owner: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj
      provider: akash1f6gmtjpx4r8qda9nxjwq26fp5mcjyqmaq5m6j7
    created_at: "140326"
    price:
      amount: "1"
      denom: uakt
    state: open
  escrow_account:
    balance:
      amount: "50000000"
      denom: uakt
    id:
      scope: bid
      xid: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj/140324/1/1/akash1f6gmtjpx4r8qda9nxjwq26fp5mcjyqmaq5m6j7
    owner: akash1f6gmtjpx4r8qda9nxjwq26fp5mcjyqmaq5m6j7
    settled_at: "140326"
    state: open
    transferred:
      amount: "0"
      denom: uakt
```

For this example, we will choose `akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal` Run this command to set the provider shell variable:

```
AKASH_PROVIDER=akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
```

Verify we have the right value populated by running:

```
echo $AKASH_PROVIDER
```

- Create a Lease

Create a lease for the bid from the chosen provider above by running this command:

```
provider-services tx market lease create -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Confirm the Lease

You can check the status of your lease by running:

```
provider-services query market lease list -owner $AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS -node $AKASH_NODE -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ
```

Note the bids will close automatically after 5 minutes, and you may get the response:

```
bid not open
```

If this happens, close your deployment and open a new deployment again. To close your deployment run this command:

```
provider-services tx deployment close -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ  -owner $AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

If your lease was successful you should see a response that ends with:

```
    state: active
```

{/* {% hint style="info" %} */}
Please note that once the lease is created, the provider will begin debiting your deployment's escrow account, even if you have not completed the deployment process by uploading the manifest in the following step.
{/* {% endhint %} */}

- Send the Manifest

Upload the manifest using the values from above step:

```
provider-services send-manifest deploy.yaml -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Confirm the URL

Now that the manifest is uploaded, your image is deployed. You can retrieve the access details by running the below:

```
provider-services lease-status -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER
```

You should see a response similar to:

```javascript
{
  "services": {
    "web": {
      "name": "web",
      "available": 1,
      "total": 1,
      "uris": [
        "rga3h05jetf9h3p6dbk62m19ck.ingress.ewr1p0.mainnet.akashian.io"
      ],
      "observed_generation": 1,
      "replicas": 1,
      "updated_replicas": 1,
      "ready_replicas": 1,
      "available_replicas": 1
    }
  },
  "forwarded_ports": {}
}
```

You can access the application by visiting the hostnames mapped to your deployment. Look for a URL/URI and copy it to your web browser.

- View your logs

You can view your application logs to debug issues or watch progress like so:

```bash
provider-services lease-logs \
  -dseq "$AKASH_DSEQ" \
  -provider "$AKASH_PROVIDER" \
  -from "$AKASH_KEY_NAME"
```

- Update the Deployment

- Update the Manifest

Update the deploy.yaml manifest file with the desired change.

_**NOTE:**_\*\* Not all attributes of the manifest file are eligible for deployment update. If the hardware specs of the manifest are updated (I.e. CPU count), a re-deployment of the workload is necessary. Other attributes, such as deployment image and funding, are eligible for updates.

- Issue Transaction for On Chain Update

```
provider-services tx deployment update deploy.yaml -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Send Updated Manifest to Provider

```
provider-services send-manifest deploy.yaml -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```



## Step 5: Deploying Using Akash Console

1. **Visit the Akash Console**: Go to the [Akash Console](https://console.akash.network/).
2. **Log in**: Use your Akash wallet to log in.
3. **Create a New Deployment**:
    - Upload your `deploy.yaml` file.
    - Follow the prompts to deploy your React app.
4. **Manage Your Deployment**: The console will show you all active deployments, and you can easily manage them.
5. **Access Your App**: The console will provide a link to your deployed application.

## Conclusion

You've now successfully built and deployed a React application on Akash. This decentralized approach to hosting your application provides resilience, lower costs, and freedom from centralized cloud providers.
