This guide walks you through deploying Geekbench 5 on Akash.

### Prerequisites

- An Akash account with sufficient balance.
- Akash CLI tools installed.
- Docker image of Geekbench 5 or a custom Dockerfile for Geekbench 5.
- Basic understanding of how to interact with Akash CLI.

### Step 1: Install Akash CLI

Ensure you have the Akash command-line tool installed. You can install Akash CLI by following the [installation guide](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/blob/master/docs/installation.md).

### Step 2: Prepare the Dockerfile or Geekbench Image

Geekbench 5 is available as a Docker image, or you can create a custom Dockerfile. Here's an example of using the official Geekbench 5 Docker image.

1. **Create a `Dockerfile`** if needed or use an existing Geekbench 5 Docker image. For example:

```dockerfile
FROM geekbench/geekbench5:latest
CMD ["geekbench5"]
```

Alternatively, use the Docker Hub image directly by specifying the name in the next steps.

### Step 3: Create an Akash Deployment YAML File

Next, create a `deployment.yaml` file that describes your deployment. For example, a simple deployment YAML file could look like this:

```yaml
version: "2.0"
services:
  geekbench:
    image: geekbench/geekbench5:latest  # Replace with your own image if needed
    expose:
      - port: 8080
    resources:
      cpu: 1
      memory: 2Gi
      storage: 2Gi
    environment:
      - GEEKBENCH_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    volume:
      - geekbench_data:/data

volumes:
  geekbench_data:
    size: 2Gi
```

### Step 4: Initialize the Akash Provider

Now that your YAML file is ready, initialize your Akash provider. Run the following command:

```bash
provider-services init
```

### Step 5: Submit Deployment to Akash

Deploy your service to Akash using the following command. The `provider-services` tool will take care of the process:

```bash
provider-services deploy -f deployment.yaml
```

This command deploys your service to the Akash network.

### Step 6: Monitor the Deployment

To monitor the deployment, use the following command:

```bash
provider-services status
```

This will provide information on whether your Geekbench 5 service is up and running.

### Step 7: Access Your Deployment

Once your service is deployed, you can access Geekbench 5 on the specified port (e.g., port `8080`). Make sure to check for any exposed services or IP addresses.

For example:

```bash
provider-services expose geekbench
```

This will show you the public IP and port to access the deployed Geekbench 5 service.

### Step 8: Cleanup (Optional)

If you no longer need the deployment, you can clean up your resources by running:

```bash
provider-services destroy
```

Now, you have a fully functional Geekbench 5 deployment on Akash.
