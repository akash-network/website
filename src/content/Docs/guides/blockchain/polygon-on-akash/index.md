Polygon is both a protocol and a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Aggregating scalable solutions on Ethereum and supporting a multi-chain Ethereum ecosystem.

Akash is the worldâ€™s first open source decentralized cloud built on a censorship-resistant, permissionless, and self-sovereign network.

In this guide we will cover how to use these two technologies together when building our decentralized apps.

## Getting Started Guides

These guides include architecture and technical documentation and a curated list of awesome apps for both Akash and Polygon.

Throughout this guide we have included resources we believe most valuable to your journey.
