Apache Storm is a distributed, real-time computation system designed for processing large streams of data with high throughput and low latency. It is widely used for tasks like real-time analytics, distributed processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, and machine learning pipelines. Apache Storm integrates seamlessly with other systems, supports a wide range of programming languages, and provides guaranteed data processing.

## **Deploying Apache Storm on Akash using the `storm:latest` Image**

Akash is a decentralized cloud computing platform that allows users to deploy containerized applications at a fraction of the cost of traditional cloud providers. Below is a step-by-step guide to deploying Apache Storm using the `storm:latest` Docker image.

---

## **Step 1: Prerequisites**

1. **Install Akash CLI**: Ensure you have the Akash Command Line Interface (CLI) installed. You can follow [Akash's documentation](/docs/deployments/akash-cli/overview/) to install and set up your CLI.
2. **Create a Wallet**: Create and fund an Akash wallet with the required AKT tokens to pay for the deployment.
3. **Install Docker**: Make sure Docker is installed to verify the `storm:latest` image locally if needed.
4. **Create an SDL Template**: Akash deployments are configured using an SDL file (Service Definition Language).

---

## **Step 2: Create the SDL File**

Below is an example of an SDL file to deploy the `storm:latest` container on Akash:

```
version: "2.0"

services:
  apache-storm:
    image: storm:latest
    expose:
      - port: 8080
        as: 80
        to:
          - global
      - port: 6627
        as: 6627
        to:
          - global
    env:
      - STORM_LOG_DIR=/var/log/storm
      - STORM_HOME=/usr/share/storm
    command:
      - "bin/storm"
      - "nimbus"

profiles:
  compute:
    apache-storm:
      resources:
        cpu:
          units: 1
        memory:
          size: 1Gi
        storage:
          size: 1Gi

  placement:
    west-coast:
      attributes:
        region: us-west
      pricing:
        apache-storm:
          denom: uakt
          amount: 100

deployment:
  apache-storm:
    west-coast:
      profile: apache-storm
      count: 1
```

---

## **Step 3: Submit the Deployment**

1. Save the SDL file as `storm-deployment.yaml`.
2. Use the Akash CLI to create and submit the deployment:
   ```
   akash tx deployment create storm-deployment.yaml --from <wallet-name>
   ```
3. Wait for the deployment to be accepted and lease to be created.

---

## **Step 4: Access Apache Storm**

Once the deployment is live:
1. Access the **Nimbus UI** (Apache Storm's web interface) at the exposed port (e.g., `http://<LEASE_IP>:80`).
2. For clients or workers to connect, use the Nimbus RPC port (6627) to submit and manage topologies.

---

## **Step 5: Verify Deployment**

1. Use the Akash CLI to get the lease status:
   ```
   akash query deployment get --owner <wallet-address> --dseq <deployment-sequence>
   ```
2. Confirm that the service is running and accessible via the assigned IP address.

---

## **Optional Configurations**

- **Scaling**: To scale the deployment (e.g., adding workers), modify the `count` in the `deployment` section of the SDL file.
- **Persistent Storage**: Add a volume to persist logs or data.
- **Custom Configuration**: Use environment variables to pass additional configurations to Storm.

---

## **Monitoring and Maintenance**

- Monitor logs using the `docker logs` equivalent in Akash for debugging.
- Regularly check resource utilization to ensure optimal performance.

By following this guide, you can successfully deploy and run Apache Storm on the Akash network, leveraging its decentralized compute infrastructure for cost-effective and scalable real-time data processing.
