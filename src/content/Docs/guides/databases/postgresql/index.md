- **PostgreSQL**: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source, object-relational database system known for its robustness, feature set, and SQL compliance. It supports advanced data types, concurrency, and scalability, making it suitable for small to enterprise-level applications.
  
- **Akash Network**: Akash is a decentralized cloud platform that enables users to deploy applications in a cost-effective, secure, and censorship-resistant manner. Using Akash, developers can deploy containerized applications such as PostgreSQL without relying on traditional centralized cloud providers.

---

#### **Key Steps to Deploy PostgreSQL on Akash**

1. **Set Up Akash CLI**:
   - Install the Akash CLI by following the [official guide](/docs/getting-started/quickstart-guides/akash-cli/).
   - Configure your wallet and fund it with AKT tokens to pay for deployments.

2. **Prepare the PostgreSQL Docker Image**:
   - Choose a PostgreSQL Docker image, such as the official `postgres` image from Docker Hub.
   - Ensure the image meets your configuration needs (version, extensions, etc.).

3. **Define an SDL File for the Deployment**:
   - The SDL (Service Definition Language) file defines the deployment's requirements, such as resource allocation, container configuration, and environment variables.

---

#### **Sample SDL File for PostgreSQL Deployment**

Below is an example SDL file to deploy PostgreSQL on Akash:

```yaml
---
version: "2.0"

services:
  postgres-db:
    image: postgres:latest
    env:
      POSTGRES_USER: "your_username"
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "your_password"
      POSTGRES_DB: "your_database"
    expose:
      - port: 5432
        as: 5432
        to:
          - global: true

profiles:
  compute:
    postgres-db:
      resources:
        cpu:
          units: 1
        memory:
          size: 1Gi
        storage:
          size: 10Gi

  placement:
    akash:
      attributes:
        region: us-west
      pricing:
        postgres-db:
          denom: uakt
          amount: 100

deployment:
  postgres-db:
    postgres-db:
      profile: postgres-db
      count: 1
```

---

#### **Key Sections of the SDL File**

1. **`services`**:
   - Defines the container image to use (`postgres:latest`).
   - Configures environment variables (`POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`) to initialize PostgreSQL.
   - Exposes PostgreSQL on port `5432` and makes it accessible globally.

2. **`profiles`**:
   - **`compute`**: Specifies resource allocation (CPU, memory, and storage).
   - **`placement`**: Determines the deployment's region and cost pricing for Akash.

3. **`deployment`**:
   - Maps the service (`postgres-db`) to the compute profile and specifies the number of container instances (`count: 1`).

---

#### **Steps to Deploy**

- Create your Certificate

Akash requires an account to have a valid certificate associated with it to start participating in the deployment process. In this section of the guide, we will create a certificate locally, and then proceed to store this certificate on the Akash blockchain. To do this, ensure you have followed all the steps outlined in this guide up to this point. Additionally, these transactions must be executed from an Akash account in possession of some $AKT tokens.

Once an account has a certificate associated with it, it can begin deploying services on the Akash blockchain. **A certificate needs to be created only once per account. After creation, it can be used across any number of deployments for as long as it remains valid.**


```
provider-services tx cert generate client -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Publish Cert to the Blockchain

```
provider-services tx cert publish client -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Create your Deployment

- CPU Support

Only x86_64 processors are officially supported for Akash deployments. This may change in the future and when ARM processors are supported it will be announced and documented.

- Akash Deployment

> _**NOTE**_ - if your current terminal session has been used to create prior deployments, issue the command `unset AKASH_DSEQ` to prevent receipt of error message `Deployment Exists`

To deploy on Akash, run:

```
provider-services tx deployment create deploy.yaml -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Find your Deployment \-

Find the Deployment Sequence (DSEQ) in the deployment you just created. You will need to replace the AKASH_DSEQ with the number from your deployment to configure a shell variable.

```bash
export AKASH_DSEQ=CHANGETHIS
```

Now set the Order Sequence (OSEQ) and Group Sequence (GSEQ). Note that if this is your first time deploying on Akash, OSEQ and GSEQ will be 1.

```bash
AKASH_OSEQ=1
AKASH_GSEQ=1
```

Verify we have the right values populated by running:

```bash
echo $AKASH_DSEQ $AKASH_OSEQ $AKASH_GSEQ
```

- View your Bids

After a short time, you should see bids from providers for this deployment with the following command:

```bash
provider-services query market bid list -owner=$AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS -node $AKASH_NODE -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -state=open
```

- Choose a Provider

Note that there are bids from multiple different providers. In this case, both providers happen to be willing to accept a price of _1 uAKT_. This means that the lease can be created using _1 uAKT_ or _0.000001 AKT_ per block to execute the container. You should see a response similar to:

```
bids:
- bid:
    bid_id:
      dseq: "140324"
      gseq: 1
      oseq: 1
      owner: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj
      provider: akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
    created_at: "140326"
    price:
      amount: "1"
      denom: uakt
    state: open
  escrow_account:
    balance:
      amount: "50000000"
      denom: uakt

    settled_at: "140326"
    state: open
    transferred:
      amount: "0"
      denom: uakt

      gseq: 1
      oseq: 1
      owner: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj
      provider: akash1f6gmtjpx4r8qda9nxjwq26fp5mcjyqmaq5m6j7
    created_at: "140326"
    price:
      amount: "1"
      denom: uakt
    state: open
  escrow_account:
    balance:
      amount: "50000000"
      denom: uakt
    id:
      scope: bid
      xid: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj/140324/1/1/akash1f6gmtjpx4r8qda9nxjwq26fp5mcjyqmaq5m6j7
    owner: akash1f6gmtjpx4r8qda9nxjwq26fp5mcjyqmaq5m6j7
    settled_at: "140326"
    state: open
    transferred:
      amount: "0"
      denom: uakt
```

For this example, we will choose `akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal` Run this command to set the provider shell variable:

```
AKASH_PROVIDER=akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
```

Verify we have the right value populated by running:

```
echo $AKASH_PROVIDER
```

- Create a Lease

Create a lease for the bid from the chosen provider above by running this command:

```
provider-services tx market lease create -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Confirm the Lease

You can check the status of your lease by running:

```
provider-services query market lease list -owner $AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS -node $AKASH_NODE -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ
```

Note the bids will close automatically after 5 minutes, and you may get the response:

```
bid not open
```

If this happens, close your deployment and open a new deployment again. To close your deployment run this command:

```
provider-services tx deployment close -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ  -owner $AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

If your lease was successful you should see a response that ends with:

```
    state: active
```

{/* {% hint style="info" %} */}
Please note that once the lease is created, the provider will begin debiting your deployment's escrow account, even if you have not completed the deployment process by uploading the manifest in the following step.
{/* {% endhint %} */}

- Send the Manifest

Upload the manifest using the values from above step:

```
provider-services send-manifest deploy.yaml -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Confirm the URL

Now that the manifest is uploaded, your image is deployed. You can retrieve the access details by running the below:

```
provider-services lease-status -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER
```

You should see a response similar to:

```javascript
{
  "services": {
    "web": {
      "name": "web",
      "available": 1,
      "total": 1,
      "uris": [
        "rga3h05jetf9h3p6dbk62m19ck.ingress.ewr1p0.mainnet.akashian.io"
      ],
      "observed_generation": 1,
      "replicas": 1,
      "updated_replicas": 1,
      "ready_replicas": 1,
      "available_replicas": 1
    }
  },
  "forwarded_ports": {}
}
```

You can access the application by visiting the hostnames mapped to your deployment. Look for a URL/URI and copy it to your web browser.

- View your logs

You can view your application logs to debug issues or watch progress like so:

```bash
provider-services lease-logs \
  -dseq "$AKASH_DSEQ" \
  -provider "$AKASH_PROVIDER" \
  -from "$AKASH_KEY_NAME"
```

- Update the Deployment

- Update the Manifest

Update the deploy.yaml manifest file with the desired change.

_**NOTE:**_\*\* Not all attributes of the manifest file are eligible for deployment update. If the hardware specs of the manifest are updated (I.e. CPU count), a re-deployment of the workload is necessary. Other attributes, such as deployment image and funding, are eligible for updates.

- Issue Transaction for On Chain Update

```
provider-services tx deployment update deploy.yaml -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Send Updated Manifest to Provider

```
provider-services send-manifest deploy.yaml -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

#### **Tips and Best Practices**

- **Backup Your Data**: Use persistent storage or an external volume to ensure your PostgreSQL data is retained after container restarts.
- **Secure Connections**: Use tools like SSH tunnels or VPNs to secure database access.
- **Scaling**: Update the `count` value in the `deployment` section to increase the number of instances.
