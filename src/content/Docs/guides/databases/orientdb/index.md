## **Overview of OrientDB**
OrientDB is an open-source, multi-model NoSQL database that combines the benefits of graph and document databases. It is designed to handle large-scale data with flexibility and efficiency, supporting ACID transactions and various querying capabilities. OrientDB is ideal for applications such as social networking, content management, and fraud detection, where relationships and data interconnectivity are critical.

### **Key Features of OrientDB**
1. **Multi-Model Support**: Offers both graph and document database capabilities.
2. **SQL-Like Query Language**: Provides SQL-like syntax for easy querying.
3. **Scalability**: Handles large datasets with support for sharding and replication.
4. **ACID Compliance**: Ensures reliable transactions.
5. **Open Source**: Freely available with a community and enterprise edition.

## **What is Akash?**
Akash is a decentralized cloud computing marketplace that allows developers to deploy and manage applications on a distributed network of providers at a lower cost compared to traditional cloud services. Akash uses **SDL (Stack Definition Language)** files to define application configurations for deployment.

---

## **Step-by-Step Guide to Deploy OrientDB on Akash**

### **Prerequisites**
1. Install the Akash CLI and set up your wallet.
2. Ensure you have AKT tokens for deployment fees.
3. Obtain the Akash provider endpoint.
4. Download OrientDB (Community Edition) or use its Docker image.

---

### **1. Create the SDL File**
The SDL file defines your deployment configuration for OrientDB on Akash. Here's a sample `deploy.yaml` file:

```
version: "2.0"

services:
  orientdb:
    image: orientdb:latest
    env:
      - ORIENTDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=yourpassword # Replace 'yourpassword' with a secure password
    expose:
      - port: 2424 # Binary Protocol Port
        as: 2424
        accept: true
        to:
          - global
      - port: 2480 # HTTP/REST API Port
        as: 2480
        accept: true
        to:
          - global

profiles:
  compute:
    orientdb:
      resources:
        cpu:
          units: 1
        memory:
          size: 2Gi
        storage:
          size: 10Gi
  placement:
    default:
      attributes:
        host: akash
      signedBy:
        anyOf:
          - akash.network
      pricing:
        orientdb:
          denom: uakt
          amount: 100

deployment:
  orientdb:
    orientdb:
      profile: orientdb
      count: 1
```

---

### **2. Steps to Deploy OrientDB**

#### **Step 1: Deploy the SDL File**
- Save the `deploy.yaml` file in your local directory.
- Create your Certificate

Akash requires an account to have a valid certificate associated with it to start participating in the deployment process. In this section of the guide, we will create a certificate locally, and then proceed to store this certificate on the Akash blockchain. To do this, ensure you have followed all the steps outlined in this guide up to this point. Additionally, these transactions must be executed from an Akash account in possession of some $AKT tokens.

Once an account has a certificate associated with it, it can begin deploying services on the Akash blockchain. **A certificate needs to be created only once per account. After creation, it can be used across any number of deployments for as long as it remains valid.**


```
provider-services tx cert generate client -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Publish Cert to the Blockchain

```
provider-services tx cert publish client -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Create your Deployment

- CPU Support

Only x86_64 processors are officially supported for Akash deployments. This may change in the future and when ARM processors are supported it will be announced and documented.

- Akash Deployment

> _**NOTE**_ - if your current terminal session has been used to create prior deployments, issue the command `unset AKASH_DSEQ` to prevent receipt of error message `Deployment Exists`

To deploy on Akash, run:

```
provider-services tx deployment create deploy.yaml -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

You should see a response similar to:

```

- Find your Deployment \-

Find the Deployment Sequence (DSEQ) in the deployment you just created. You will need to replace the AKASH_DSEQ with the number from your deployment to configure a shell variable.

```bash
export AKASH_DSEQ=CHANGETHIS
```

Now set the Order Sequence (OSEQ) and Group Sequence (GSEQ). Note that if this is your first time deploying on Akash, OSEQ and GSEQ will be 1.

```bash
AKASH_OSEQ=1
AKASH_GSEQ=1
```

Verify we have the right values populated by running:

```bash
echo $AKASH_DSEQ $AKASH_OSEQ $AKASH_GSEQ
```

- View your Bids

After a short time, you should see bids from providers for this deployment with the following command:

```bash
provider-services query market bid list -owner=$AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS -node $AKASH_NODE -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -state=open
```

- Choose a Provider

Note that there are bids from multiple different providers. In this case, both providers happen to be willing to accept a price of _1 uAKT_. This means that the lease can be created using _1 uAKT_ or _0.000001 AKT_ per block to execute the container. You should see a response similar to:

```
bids:
- bid:
    bid_id:
      dseq: "140324"
      gseq: 1
      oseq: 1
      owner: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj
      provider: akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
    created_at: "140326"
    price:
      amount: "1"
      denom: uakt
    state: open
  escrow_account:
    balance:
      amount: "50000000"
      denom: uakt
    id:
      scope: bid
      xid: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj/140324/1/1/akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
    owner: akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
    settled_at: "140326"
    state: open
    transferred:
      amount: "0"
      denom: uakt
- bid:
    bid_id:
      dseq: "140324"
      gseq: 1
      oseq: 1
      owner: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj
      provider: akash1f6gmtjpx4r8qda9nxjwq26fp5mcjyqmaq5m6j7
    created_at: "140326"
    price:
      amount: "1"
      denom: uakt
    state: open
  escrow_account:
    balance:
      amount: "50000000"
      denom: uakt
    id:
      scope: bid
      xid: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj/140324/1/1/akash1f6gmtjpx4r8qda9nxjwq26fp5mcjyqmaq5m6j7
    owner: akash1f6gmtjpx4r8qda9nxjwq26fp5mcjyqmaq5m6j7
    settled_at: "140326"
    state: open
    transferred:
      amount: "0"
      denom: uakt
```

For this example, we will choose `akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal` Run this command to set the provider shell variable:

```
AKASH_PROVIDER=akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
```

Verify we have the right value populated by running:

```
echo $AKASH_PROVIDER
```

- Create a Lease

Create a lease for the bid from the chosen provider above by running this command:

```
provider-services tx market lease create -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Confirm the Lease

You can check the status of your lease by running:

```
provider-services query market lease list -owner $AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS -node $AKASH_NODE -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ
```

Note the bids will close automatically after 5 minutes, and you may get the response:

```
bid not open
```

If this happens, close your deployment and open a new deployment again. To close your deployment run this command:

```
provider-services tx deployment close -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ  -owner $AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

If your lease was successful you should see a response that ends with:

```
    state: active
```

{/* {% hint style="info" %} */}
Please note that once the lease is created, the provider will begin debiting your deployment's escrow account, even if you have not completed the deployment process by uploading the manifest in the following step.
{/* {% endhint %} */}

- Send the Manifest

Upload the manifest using the values from above step:

```
provider-services send-manifest deploy.yaml -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Confirm the URL

Now that the manifest is uploaded, your image is deployed. You can retrieve the access details by running the below:

```
provider-services lease-status -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER
```

You should see a response similar to:

```javascript
{
  "services": {
    "web": {
      "name": "web",
      "available": 1,
      "total": 1,
      "uris": [
        "rga3h05jetf9h3p6dbk62m19ck.ingress.ewr1p0.mainnet.akashian.io"
      ],
      "observed_generation": 1,
      "replicas": 1,
      "updated_replicas": 1,
      "ready_replicas": 1,
      "available_replicas": 1
    }
  },
  "forwarded_ports": {}
}
```

You can access the application by visiting the hostnames mapped to your deployment. Look for a URL/URI and copy it to your web browser.

- View your logs

You can view your application logs to debug issues or watch progress like so:

```bash
provider-services lease-logs \
  -dseq "$AKASH_DSEQ" \
  -provider "$AKASH_PROVIDER" \
  -from "$AKASH_KEY_NAME"
```

- Update the Deployment

- Update the Manifest

Update the deploy.yaml manifest file with the desired change.

_**NOTE:**_\*\* Not all attributes of the manifest file are eligible for deployment update. If the hardware specs of the manifest are updated (I.e. CPU count), a re-deployment of the workload is necessary. Other attributes, such as deployment image and funding, are eligible for updates.

- Issue Transaction for On Chain Update

```
provider-services tx deployment update deploy.yaml -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Send Updated Manifest to Provider

```
provider-services send-manifest deploy.yaml -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```


- Access OrientDB using its exposed endpoints:
  - Binary Protocol: `tcp://<provider_endpoint>:2424`
  - HTTP/REST API: `http://<provider_endpoint>:2480`

---

### **3. Verifying OrientDB Deployment**
1. Use the OrientDB Web Console:
   - Navigate to `http://<provider_endpoint>:2480`.
   - Log in with `root` as the username and the password specified in the SDL file.

2. Test OrientDB with a sample database:
   - Create a new database using the Web Console.
   - Run queries to verify functionality.

---

### **4. Additional Notes**
- **Scaling**: Modify the `count` in the deployment profile to scale horizontally.
- **Monitoring**: Use Akash’s logs and metrics tools to monitor your OrientDB instance.
- **Persistence**: Add volume mounts for data persistence in the SDL file if required.

---

### **5. Cleanup**
To delete the deployment and free resources:

```bash
provider-services tx deployment close --owner <your_wallet_address> --dseq <deployment_sequence> --from <your_wallet_name>
```

---

By following this guide, you can effectively deploy and manage OrientDB on Akash's decentralized cloud platform, leveraging its cost-effectiveness and scalability.
