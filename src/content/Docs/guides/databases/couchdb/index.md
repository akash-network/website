[Apache CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/), often shortened to just "CouchDB", is an open-source NoSQL database that uses JSON to store data, JavaScript as its query language using MapReduce, and HTTP for its API. It’s known for its ease of use, scalability, and fault-tolerant replication capabilities, making it a popular choice for distributed applications.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before deploying CouchDB on Akash, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Akash Network Account: You should have an account on the Akash Network with sufficient AKT tokens to deploy the service.

2. [Akash CLI](/docs/getting-started/quickstart-guides/akash-cli/) or [Console](https://console.akash.network/) Access: Set up and configured on your machine.

3. Docker Knowledge: Familiarity with Docker is helpful.

## Creating the SDL File

Below is a sample SDL file to deploy CouchDB using the official Docker image:

```
---
version: "2.0"

services:
  couchdb:
    image: couchdb 
    env:
      - COUCHDB_USER=admin
      - COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password
    expose:
      - port: 5984
        as: 80
        to:
          - global: true

profiles:
  compute:
    couchdb:
      resources:
        cpu:
          units: 1.0
        memory:
          size: 1Gi
        storage:
          size: 1Gi
  placement:
    akash:
      attributes:
        host: akash
      signedBy:
        anyOf:
          - "akash1365yvmc4s7awdyj3n2sav7xfx76adc6dnmlx63"
      pricing:
        couchdb: 
          denom: uakt
          amount: 10000

deployment:
  couchdb:
    akash:
      profile: couchdb
      count: 1
```

- `services`: Defines the Docker image and port mapping.

- `profiles`: Specifies the compute resources required (CPU, memory, and storage).

- `deployment`: Sets the profile and instance count.

Save this file as `deploy.yaml`.


## Deploying CouchDB on Akash 

### Using the CLI

**Step 1: Authenticate with Akash**

- Create your Certificate

Akash requires an account to have a valid certificate associated with it to start participating in the deployment process. In this section of the guide, we will create a certificate locally, and then proceed to store this certificate on the Akash blockchain. To do this, ensure you have followed all the steps outlined in this guide up to this point. Additionally, these transactions must be executed from an Akash account in possession of some $AKT tokens.

Once an account has a certificate associated with it, it can begin deploying services on the Akash blockchain. **A certificate needs to be created only once per account. After creation, it can be used across any number of deployments for as long as it remains valid.**


```
provider-services tx cert generate client -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Publish Cert to the Blockchain

```
provider-services tx cert publish client -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Create your Deployment

- CPU Support

Only x86_64 processors are officially supported for Akash deployments. This may change in the future and when ARM processors are supported it will be announced and documented.

- Akash Deployment

> _**NOTE**_ - if your current terminal session has been used to create prior deployments, issue the command `unset AKASH_DSEQ` to prevent receipt of error message `Deployment Exists`

To deploy on Akash, run:

```
provider-services tx deployment create deploy.yaml -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

You should see a response similar to:

- Find your Deployment \-

Find the Deployment Sequence (DSEQ) in the deployment you just created. You will need to replace the AKASH_DSEQ with the number from your deployment to configure a shell variable.

```bash
export AKASH_DSEQ=CHANGETHIS
```

Now set the Order Sequence (OSEQ) and Group Sequence (GSEQ). Note that if this is your first time deploying on Akash, OSEQ and GSEQ will be 1.

```bash
AKASH_OSEQ=1
AKASH_GSEQ=1
```

Verify we have the right values populated by running:

```bash
echo $AKASH_DSEQ $AKASH_OSEQ $AKASH_GSEQ
```

- View your Bids

After a short time, you should see bids from providers for this deployment with the following command:

```bash
provider-services query market bid list -owner=$AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS -node $AKASH_NODE -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -state=open
```

- Choose a Provider

Note that there are bids from multiple different providers. In this case, both providers happen to be willing to accept a price of _1 uAKT_. This means that the lease can be created using _1 uAKT_ or _0.000001 AKT_ per block to execute the container. You should see a response similar to:

```
bids:
- bid:
    bid_id:
      dseq: "140324"
      gseq: 1
      oseq: 1
      owner: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj
      provider: akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
    created_at: "140326"
    price:
      amount: "1"
      denom: uakt
    state: open
  escrow_account:
    balance:
      amount: "50000000"
      denom: uakt
    id:
      scope: bid
      xid: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj/140324/1/1/akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
    owner: akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
    settled_at: "140326"
    state: open
    transferred:
      amount: "0"
      denom: uakt
- bid:
    bid_id:
      dseq: "140324"
      gseq: 1
      oseq: 1
      owner: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj
      provider: akash1f6gmtjpx4r8qda9nxjwq26fp5mcjyqmaq5m6j7
    created_at: "140326"
    price:
      amount: "1"
      denom: uakt
    state: open
  escrow_account:
    balance:
      amount: "50000000"
      denom: uakt
    id:
      scope: bid
      xid: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj/140324/1/1/akash1f6gmtjpx4r8qda9nxjwq26fp5mcjyqmaq5m6j7
    owner: akash1f6gmtjpx4r8qda9nxjwq26fp5mcjyqmaq5m6j7
    settled_at: "140326"
    state: open
    transferred:
      amount: "0"
      denom: uakt
```

For this example, we will choose `akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal` Run this command to set the provider shell variable:

```
AKASH_PROVIDER=akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
```

Verify we have the right value populated by running:

```
echo $AKASH_PROVIDER
```

- Create a Lease

Create a lease for the bid from the chosen provider above by running this command:

```
provider-services tx market lease create -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Confirm the Lease

You can check the status of your lease by running:

```
provider-services query market lease list -owner $AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS -node $AKASH_NODE -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ
```

Note the bids will close automatically after 5 minutes, and you may get the response:

```
bid not open
```

If this happens, close your deployment and open a new deployment again. To close your deployment run this command:

```
provider-services tx deployment close -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ  -owner $AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

If your lease was successful you should see a response that ends with:

```
    state: active
```

{/* {% hint style="info" %} */}
Please note that once the lease is created, the provider will begin debiting your deployment's escrow account, even if you have not completed the deployment process by uploading the manifest in the following step.
{/* {% endhint %} */}

- Send the Manifest

Upload the manifest using the values from above step:

```
provider-services send-manifest deploy.yaml -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Confirm the URL

Now that the manifest is uploaded, your image is deployed. You can retrieve the access details by running the below:

```
provider-services lease-status -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER
```

You should see a response similar to:

```javascript
{
  "services": {
    "web": {
      "name": "web",
      "available": 1,
      "total": 1,
      "uris": [
        "rga3h05jetf9h3p6dbk62m19ck.ingress.ewr1p0.mainnet.akashian.io"
      ],
      "observed_generation": 1,
      "replicas": 1,
      "updated_replicas": 1,
      "ready_replicas": 1,
      "available_replicas": 1
    }
  },
  "forwarded_ports": {}
}
```

You can access the application by visiting the hostnames mapped to your deployment. Look for a URL/URI and copy it to your web browser.

- View your logs

You can view your application logs to debug issues or watch progress like so:

```bash
provider-services lease-logs \
  -dseq "$AKASH_DSEQ" \
  -provider "$AKASH_PROVIDER" \
  -from "$AKASH_KEY_NAME"
```

- Update the Deployment

- Update the Manifest

Update the deploy.yaml manifest file with the desired change.

_**NOTE:**_\*\* Not all attributes of the manifest file are eligible for deployment update. If the hardware specs of the manifest are updated (I.e. CPU count), a re-deployment of the workload is necessary. Other attributes, such as deployment image and funding, are eligible for updates.

- Issue Transaction for On Chain Update

```
provider-services tx deployment update deploy.yaml -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Send Updated Manifest to Provider

```
provider-services send-manifest deploy.yaml -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```


For a more detailed CLI deployment guide, refer to [Akash CLI Deployment Guide](/docs/getting-started/quickstart-guides/akash-cli/) on the Akash documentation site.

### Using the Console

If you prefer a UI-based approach, you can deploy CouchDB using the Akash Console:

1. Visit the [Akash Consol](https://console.akash.network/deployments)e.

2. Sign in with your Keplr wallet.

2. Upload your deploy.yaml SDL file in the "Create Deployment" section.

3. Configure the deployment settings (similar to the CLI method).

4. Submit the deployment and fund it with the required AKT.

5. Monitor the deployment status via the console interface.

For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the [Akash Console Guide](/docs/getting-started/quickstart-guides/akash-console/).

## Post-Deployment: Setting Up CouchDB

After your CouchDB instance is up and running:

1. **Access the CouchDB Dashboard**: 

- Use the IP or domain provided during the deployment.

- The default port for CouchDB is `5984`.

2. **Secure CouchDB**:

- CouchDB is insecure by default. Set up an admin user by running the following command:

```
curl -X PUT http://<your-ip>:5984/_node/_local/_config/admins/admin -d '"password"'
```
- Replace `<your-ip>` with your actual IP and `password` with your desired admin password.

3. **Verify Installation**:

Access the CouchDB dashboard by navigating to `http://<your-ip>:5984/_utils/`.
