linkTitle: "InfluxDB"
---



This guide will help you deploy **InfluxDB** on the Akash Network using the official InfluxDB Docker image. 

---
## **Overview of InfluxDB**

**InfluxDB** is a high-performance time-series database designed to handle large amounts of data generated by IoT devices, DevOps monitoring, and analytics applications. It is used for storing, querying, and visualizing metrics and events over time. Key features include:

- **Time-series data storage**: Efficiently stores and retrieves time-stamped data.
- **Powerful query language**: Supports InfluxQL or Flux for querying data.
- **Data visualization**: Integrates with tools like Grafana or its native UI.
- **High availability**: Scalable for production-level deployments.

## **Requirements**

1. **Akash CLI**: Installed and configured.
2. **Docker**: Installed locally for creating/testing deployments (optional).
3. **An Akash Wallet**: Funded with AKT tokens.
4. **SDL Template**: For deploying the InfluxDB Docker container.

---

## **Steps to Deploy InfluxDB on Akash**

### **1. Prepare the SDL File**

The **SDL (Service Definition Language)** file specifies the configuration for deploying the InfluxDB Docker container. Below is an example SDL file for deploying InfluxDB:

```
---
version: "2.0"

services:
  influxdb:
    image: influxdb:latest
    expose:
      - port: 8086
        as: 80
        to:
          - global: true
    env:
      - INFLUXDB_DB=my_database
      - INFLUXDB_ADMIN_USER=admin
      - INFLUXDB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin_password
      - INFLUXDB_USER=my_user
      - INFLUXDB_USER_PASSWORD=my_user_password

profiles:
  compute:
    influxdb:
      resources:
        cpu: 0.5
        memory: 512Mi
        storage: 1Gi
  placement:
    akash:
      attributes:
        region: us-west
      pricing:
        influxdb:
          denom: uakt
          amount: 100

deployment:
  influxdb:
    influxdb:
      profile: influxdb
      count: 1
```
Save it as `deploy.yaml`.

### **2. Customize Your Deployment**

- **Database Configuration**:
  - Update the environment variables (e.g., `INFLUXDB_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `INFLUXDB_USER_PASSWORD`) with your preferred credentials.
- **Resource Allocation**:
  - Adjust `cpu`, `memory`, and `storage` in the `compute` profile to match your application requirements.
- **Region and Pricing**:
  - Set the `region` to your preferred Akash network location and pricing as needed.

### **3. Deploy on Akash**

- Create your Certificate

Akash requires an account to have a valid certificate associated with it to start participating in the deployment process. In this section of the guide, we will create a certificate locally, and then proceed to store this certificate on the Akash blockchain. To do this, ensure you have followed all the steps outlined in this guide up to this point. Additionally, these transactions must be executed from an Akash account in possession of some $AKT tokens.

Once an account has a certificate associated with it, it can begin deploying services on the Akash blockchain. **A certificate needs to be created only once per account. After creation, it can be used across any number of deployments for as long as it remains valid.**


```
provider-services tx cert generate client -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Publish Cert to the Blockchain

```
provider-services tx cert publish client -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Create your Deployment

- CPU Support

Only x86_64 processors are officially supported for Akash deployments. This may change in the future and when ARM processors are supported it will be announced and documented.

- Akash Deployment

> _**NOTE**_ - if your current terminal session has been used to create prior deployments, issue the command `unset AKASH_DSEQ` to prevent receipt of error message `Deployment Exists`

To deploy on Akash, run:

```
provider-services tx deployment create deploy.yaml -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

You should see a response similar to:

```

- Find your Deployment \-

Find the Deployment Sequence (DSEQ) in the deployment you just created. You will need to replace the AKASH_DSEQ with the number from your deployment to configure a shell variable.

```bash
export AKASH_DSEQ=CHANGETHIS
```

Now set the Order Sequence (OSEQ) and Group Sequence (GSEQ). Note that if this is your first time deploying on Akash, OSEQ and GSEQ will be 1.

```bash
AKASH_OSEQ=1
AKASH_GSEQ=1
```

Verify we have the right values populated by running:

```bash
echo $AKASH_DSEQ $AKASH_OSEQ $AKASH_GSEQ
```

- View your Bids

After a short time, you should see bids from providers for this deployment with the following command:

```bash
provider-services query market bid list -owner=$AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS -node $AKASH_NODE -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -state=open
```

- Choose a Provider

Note that there are bids from multiple different providers. In this case, both providers happen to be willing to accept a price of _1 uAKT_. This means that the lease can be created using _1 uAKT_ or _0.000001 AKT_ per block to execute the container. You should see a response similar to:

```
bids:
- bid:
    bid_id:
      dseq: "140324"
      gseq: 1
      oseq: 1
      owner: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj
      provider: akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
    created_at: "140326"
    price:
      amount: "1"
      denom: uakt
    state: open
  escrow_account:
    balance:
      amount: "50000000"
      denom: uakt
    id:
      scope: bid
      xid: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj/140324/1/1/akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
    owner: akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
    settled_at: "140326"
    state: open
    transferred:
      amount: "0"
      denom: uakt
- bid:
    bid_id:
      dseq: "140324"
      gseq: 1
      oseq: 1
      owner: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj
      provider: akash1f6gmtjpx4r8qda9nxjwq26fp5mcjyqmaq5m6j7
    created_at: "140326"
    price:
      amount: "1"
      denom: uakt
    state: open
  escrow_account:
    balance:
      amount: "50000000"
      denom: uakt
    id:
      scope: bid
      xid: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj/140324/1/1/akash1f6gmtjpx4r8qda9nxjwq26fp5mcjyqmaq5m6j7
    owner: akash1f6gmtjpx4r8qda9nxjwq26fp5mcjyqmaq5m6j7
    settled_at: "140326"
    state: open
    transferred:
      amount: "0"
      denom: uakt
```

For this example, we will choose `akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal` Run this command to set the provider shell variable:

```
AKASH_PROVIDER=akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
```

Verify we have the right value populated by running:

```
echo $AKASH_PROVIDER
```

- Create a Lease

Create a lease for the bid from the chosen provider above by running this command:

```
provider-services tx market lease create -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Confirm the Lease

You can check the status of your lease by running:

```
provider-services query market lease list -owner $AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS -node $AKASH_NODE -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ
```

Note the bids will close automatically after 5 minutes, and you may get the response:

```
bid not open
```

If this happens, close your deployment and open a new deployment again. To close your deployment run this command:

```
provider-services tx deployment close -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ  -owner $AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

If your lease was successful you should see a response that ends with:

```
    state: active
```

{/* {% hint style="info" %} */}
Please note that once the lease is created, the provider will begin debiting your deployment's escrow account, even if you have not completed the deployment process by uploading the manifest in the following step.
{/* {% endhint %} */}

- Send the Manifest

Upload the manifest using the values from above step:

```
provider-services send-manifest deploy.yaml -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Confirm the URL

Now that the manifest is uploaded, your image is deployed. You can retrieve the access details by running the below:

```
provider-services lease-status -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER
```

You should see a response similar to:

```javascript
{
  "services": {
    "web": {
      "name": "web",
      "available": 1,
      "total": 1,
      "uris": [
        "rga3h05jetf9h3p6dbk62m19ck.ingress.ewr1p0.mainnet.akashian.io"
      ],
      "observed_generation": 1,
      "replicas": 1,
      "updated_replicas": 1,
      "ready_replicas": 1,
      "available_replicas": 1
    }
  },
  "forwarded_ports": {}
}
```

You can access the application by visiting the hostnames mapped to your deployment. Look for a URL/URI and copy it to your web browser.

- View your logs

You can view your application logs to debug issues or watch progress like so:

```bash
provider-services lease-logs \
  -dseq "$AKASH_DSEQ" \
  -provider "$AKASH_PROVIDER" \
  -from "$AKASH_KEY_NAME"
```

- Update the Deployment

- Update the Manifest

Update the deploy.yaml manifest file with the desired change.

_**NOTE:**_\*\* Not all attributes of the manifest file are eligible for deployment update. If the hardware specs of the manifest are updated (I.e. CPU count), a re-deployment of the workload is necessary. Other attributes, such as deployment image and funding, are eligible for updates.

- Issue Transaction for On Chain Update

```
provider-services tx deployment update deploy.yaml -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Send Updated Manifest to Provider

```
provider-services send-manifest deploy.yaml -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

### **4. Access the **Deployment**:
   Retrieve the external IP or URL assigned to your service. The InfluxDB API/UI will be accessible on port **80** or the domain configured by the Akash provider.

###  Verify the Deployment**

1. **Access InfluxDB**:
   Open the assigned domain or IP in a web browser or use `curl`:
   ```bash
   curl http://<your-deployment-url>:80/ping
   ```
   If InfluxDB is running, it will return a `204 No Content` response.

2. **Login to the Admin UI**:
   Navigate to `http://<your-deployment-url>:80` in a browser. Use the credentials set in the environment variables (e.g., `INFLUXDB_ADMIN_USER` and `INFLUXDB_ADMIN_PASSWORD`).

### **5. Connect Your Applications**

Use the InfluxDB URL to connect applications or tools like Grafana for visualizing your data. Example of connecting using InfluxQL:
```bash
curl -XPOST 'http://<your-deployment-url>:80/query' \
-d 'q=CREATE DATABASE my_database' \
--user admin:admin_password
```

---

## **Key Notes**

1. **Persistent Storage**:
   - Akash provides persistent storage with only during the lease. Review the [documentation](/docs/network-features/persistent-storage/) for a further explanation of the limitations.

2. **Scaling**:
   - Modify the `count` parameter in the `deployment` section to scale horizontally.

3. **Security**:
   - Always use strong passwords for your database and user accounts.
   - Use a firewall or restrict access to specific IPs for production environments.

---

By following these steps, you'll have InfluxDB running on Akash, providing a scalable, decentralized solution for your time-series data needs.
