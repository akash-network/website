### Accessing Historical Data for Akash 

The [Indexer repository](https://github.com/akash-network/console/tree/main/apps/indexer) contains a collection of tools for accessing historical data for Akash.

Full instructions for running the indexed can be found directly in the repository and discussions related to the indexer can be found in the [SIG Analytics Channel](https://discord.com/channels/747885925232672829/1111760414414475284) in the Akash Network Discord.

Accessing this data typically requires downloading a snapshot on your machine and then running the indexer with a live RPC.

If you'd prefer a lightweight solution to query historical data in SQL, all of the 500+ GBs of data is available in the [Akash Network Chakra Dataset](https://console.chakra.dev/marketplace/dataset/7cdef35d-4334-41b6-871e-d3660dcd013f) for free consumption.
