Praetor App simplifies the process of becoming a cloud provider for the Akash Network. Instead of using a Command-line Interface, you can manage everything through our user-friendly interface. Once you set up as a provider, deployers who choose your services will pay you in AKT. [Praetor is now called Akash provider console](https://provider-console.akash.network/)

With Praetor App, you can offer a single server or multiple servers, supporting operating systems like Ubuntu, Debian, and CentOS.

Got underutilized Kubernetes? You can also integrate it with the Akash Network through Praetor App. Our app helps you configure your existing Kubernetes setup for Akash Network compatibility and initiates the Provider Service necessary to accept bids and manifests.
