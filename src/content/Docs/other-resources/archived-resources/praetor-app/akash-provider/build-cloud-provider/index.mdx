## Prerequisites of an Akash Provider

### Wallet Funding - Minimum of 5 AKT

To place a bid on an order, a deposit of 5 AKT is required. This deposit is fully refunded regardless of whether the bid is won or lost.

For detailed steps on creating an Akash account, please refer to our [documentation](/docs/deployments/akash-cli/installation/).

### Kubernetes Cluster Hardware Requirements and Recommendations

Kubernetes Master Node Requirements

- Minimum Specifications:

  - 8 CPUs
  - 16 GB RAM
  - 50 GB Disk

- Recommended Specifications:

  - 16 CPUs
  - 32 GB RAM
  - 100 GB Disk

Kubernetes Worker Node Requirements

- Minimum Specifications:

  - 4 CPUs
  - 8 GB RAM
  - 100 GB Disk

- Recommendations:

  - The more resources available, the better the performance, especially for handling a higher number of concurrent deployments.
  - It is crucial to maximize CPU capacity. For instance, with 8 CPUs, 100 GB RAM, and 2 TB storage, the CPU would likely be the bottleneck. Since people tend to deploy at least 1 CPU per deployment, the server could only host 8 deployments maximum and likely about 6 deployments as other ~2 CPUs will be reserved by the Kubernetes system components.
