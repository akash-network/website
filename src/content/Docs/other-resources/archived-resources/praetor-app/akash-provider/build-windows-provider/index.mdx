3. Follow the prompts to complete the OS installation (this typically takes 10-15 minutes).

4. After installation, restart the VM.

## Step 2d: Configure the OS

1. If the user is a sudo user, refer to the [sudo user requirements](../sudo-user-reqs/).

2. Open the terminal and type `ip a` to get your private IPv4 address.

## Step 3: Port Forwarding

1. Access your router's configuration page and set up port forwarding to the IPv4 address obtained earlier.
  * Port 8443, 8444: For running Akash Provider service.

  * Port 80, 443: For applications deployed under your provider.

  * Port 22: For SSH connections.

  * Ports 30000-32767: For other TCP/UDP connections.

You are now ready to become an Akash cloud provider. First, you will need to know your public IP address.
