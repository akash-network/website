## Specific GPU Vendor

### Overview

In the example SDL provided below the following request is made:

- GPU Quantity: 1
- GPU Vendor: NVIDIA

Based on these inclusions in the SDL - only providers that have NVIDIA chips will respond with a bid.

> _**NOTE**_ - using this SDL example no specific GPU model/type (I.e. NVIDIA A100) is specified. Based on this syntax any provider with a NVIDIA GPU will respond with a bid. If a specific GPU model/type is needed - use the SDL example [here](#specific-gpu-vendor--model).

### SDL Example

```

version: "2.0"

services:
  obtaingpu:
    image: ubuntu:22.04
    command:
      - "sh"
      - "-c"
    args:
      - 'uptime;
        nvidia-smi;
        sleep infinity'
    expose:
      - port: 8080
        as: 80
        to:
          - global: true

      pricing:
        obtaingpu:

          amount: 100000

deployment:
  obtaingpu:
    akash:
      profile: obtaingpu
      count: 1

```

### Confirmation

- The SDL used in the provided example prints the GPU Model/Chip Type to the logs as depicted below
- We can use these logs to determine the success of the deployment

### Specific GPU Vendor & Model

### Overview

In the example SDL provided below the following request is made:

- GPU Quantity: 1
- GPU Vendor: NVIDIA
- GPU Model: T4

Based on these inclusions in the SDL - only providers that have NVIDIA T4 chips will respond with a bid.

deployment:
  obtaingpu:
    akash:
      profile: obtaingpu
      count: 1

```

### Confirmation

- The SDL used in the provided example prints the GPU Model/Chip Type to the logs as depicted below
- We can use these logs to determine the success of the deployment and confirm that the requested GPU model/type was allocated

## Specific GPU Vendor & List of Acceptable Models

### Overview

In the example SDL provided below the following request is made:

- GPU Quantity: 1
- GPU Vendor: NVIDIA
- GPU Model: T4 or A4000

Based on these inclusions in the SDL - only providers that have NVIDIA T4 OR A4000 chips will respond with a bid. The purpose of this SDL use would be in scenario in which specific models of GPU are necessary but there are multiple, acceptable models.&#x20;

&#x20;In this example we specific that providers with NVIDIA T4 or A4000 models should bid on the deployment. But it is possible to list many different models if desired.
