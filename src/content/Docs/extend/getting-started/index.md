**Integrate Akash Network into your applications and infrastructure.**

This section provides comprehensive resources for extending Akash Network through SDKs, APIs, and architectural documentation.

---

## For Developers

### SDKs
Build deployment and provider management capabilities directly into your applications:

- **[Akash SDK](/docs/extend/sdk)** - Official Go and JavaScript/TypeScript SDKs
- **[Installation Guide](/docs/extend/sdk/installation)** - Get started with SDK installation
- **[Quick Start](/docs/extend/sdk/quick-start)** - Deploy your first application programmatically
- **[API Reference](/docs/extend/sdk/api-reference)** - Complete SDK documentation
- **[Examples](/docs/extend/sdk/examples)** - Code examples for common tasks

### APIs
Programmatic access to Akash features:

- **[Console Managed Wallet API](/docs/extend/api/managed-wallet)** - Deploy without managing wallets
- **[Node API Layer](/docs/node-operators/architecture/api-layer)** - gRPC, REST, and RPC endpoints

---

## Use Cases

### When to Use SDKs
- Build deployment automation tools
- Integrate Akash into existing platforms
- Create custom deployment workflows
- Build provider management dashboards
- Develop monitoring and analytics tools

### When to Use APIs
- Deploy containers without wallet management
- Accept credit card payments for deployments
- Build SaaS platforms on Akash
- Automate deployment lifecycles
- Create user-friendly deployment interfaces

### When to Use Architecture Docs
- Understanding provider internals
- Contributing to provider codebase
- Debugging provider issues
- Building provider management tools
- Optimizing provider operations
