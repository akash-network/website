#### Expected Success

#### **SIMPLE PERSISTENT STORAGE DEPLOYMENT TEST WITH BETA2 STORAGE TYPE**

* _**Description**_ - verify simple persistent storage deployment with the storage type of BETA2.
* [Current SDL](https://github.com/akash-network/provider/blob/f13aca40ac42f96b80ec5e863cdfa20093e23b44/testdata/deployment/deployment-v2-storage-beta2.yaml) - `deployment-v2-storage-beta2.yaml`
* _**Expected Outcome**_ - successful deployment/order creation with associated provider bid receipt for persistent storage type of BETA2.

#### **SIMPLE PERSISTENT STORAGE DEPLOYMENT TEST WITH NO STORAGE TYPE DEFINED**

* _**Description**_ - verify simple persistent storage deployment with the storage type omitted/not populated.
* [Current SDL](https://github.com/akash-network/provider/blob/main/testdata/deployment/deployment-v2-storage-default.yaml) - `deployment-v2-storage-default.yaml`
* _**Expected Outcome**_ - successful deployment/order creation. Note - no providers on the network (at the time of this writing) bid on the default storage type.
* _**Current Coverage**_ - [end to end test coverage](https://github.com/akash-network/provider/blob/main/integration/persistentstorage\_test.go)

**PERSISTENT STORAGE DEPLOYMENT UPDATE TEST A**

* _**Description**_ - verify deployment update capability when persistent storage is included in the workload.
* [Current SDL](https://github.com/akash-network/provider/blob/main/testdata/deployment/deployment-v2-storage-updateA.yaml) - `deployment-v2-storage-updateA.yaml`
* _**Expected Outcome**_ - successful update of image and/or env variables when persistent storage is included in deployment.

**PERSISTENT STORAGE DEPLOYMENT UPDATE TEST B**

* _**Description**_ - verify deployment update capability when persistent storage is included in the workload.
* [Current SDL](https://github.com/akash-network/provider/blob/main/testdata/deployment/deployment-v2-storage-updateB.yaml) - `deployment-v2-storage-updateB.yaml`
* _**Expected Outcome**_ - successful update of image and/or env variables when persistent storage is included in deployment.

#### Expected Failure

#### SIMPLE PERSISTENT STORAGE DEPLOYMENT TEST WITH NO MOUNT SPECIFIED 

* _**Description**_ - Failure test when no mount point is provided for persistent storage use
* [Current SDL](https://github.com/akash-network/provider/blob/f13aca40ac42f96b80ec5e863cdfa20093e23b44/testdata/sdl/storageClass1.yaml) - `storageClass1.yaml`
* _**Expected Outcome**_ - The SDL should fail validation on deployment creation attempt as there is no mount point specified for persistent storage in the `services > params > storage > configs` stanza.

#### **SIMPLE PERSISTENT STORAGE DEPLOYMENT TEST FAIL ON NO ABSOLUTE MOUNT PATH**

* _**Description**_ - Failure test when no absolute directory path is supplied in mount point.
* [Current SDL](https://github.com/akash-network/provider/blob/f13aca40ac42f96b80ec5e863cdfa20093e23b44/testdata/sdl/storageClass2.yaml) - `storageClass2.yaml`
* _**Expected Outcome**_ - The SDL should fail validation on deployment creation attempt as the persistent storage mount point specified is a relative path of `etc/nginx`. If the path were the absolute path of `/etc/nginx`, the validation would succeed.

#### **SIMPLE PERSISTENT STORAGE DEPLOYMENT TEST FAIL ON INVALID NAME**

* _**Description**_ - Failure test when the persistent storage name does not align with the name provided in the services stanza.
* [Current SDL](https://github.com/akash-network/provider/blob/f13aca40ac42f96b80ec5e863cdfa20093e23b44/testdata/sdl/storageClass3.yaml) - `storageClass3.yaml`
* _**Expected Outcome**_ - The SDL should fail validation on deployment creation attempt as the persistent storage name specified in the `profiles` stanza - which is `configs` - does not align with the name used in the `services` stanza which is `data`.

#### **SIMPLE PERSISTENT STORAGE DEPLOYMENT TEST FAIL ON ATTEMPT TO USE MOUNT PATH TWICE**

* _**Description**_ - Failure test when a single mount path is used on more than one persistent storage volume.
* [Current SDL](https://github.com/akash-network/provider/blob/f13aca40ac42f96b80ec5e863cdfa20093e23b44/testdata/sdl/storageClass4.yaml) - `storageClass4.yaml`
* _**Expected Outcome**_ - The SDL should fail validation on deployment creation attempt as the persistent storage mount point of `/etc/nginx` is used on multiple persistent storage volumes within the `services` stanza.

#### **SIMPLE PERSISTENT STORAGE DEPLOYMENT TEST FAIL ON NO SERVICE CONFIG**

* _**Description**_ - Failure test when no config for persistent storage is present in the `services > params > storage` stanza.
* [Current SDL](https://github.com/akash-network/provider/blob/f13aca40ac42f96b80ec5e863cdfa20093e23b44/testdata/sdl/storageClass5.yaml) - `storageClass5.yaml`
* _**Expected Outcome**_ - The SDL should fail validation on deployment creation attempt as the `params > storage` section of the `services` stanza does not contain expected specifications (volume name and mount point).

* _**Expected Outcome**_ - assignment of valid HTTP URL for web services. Current SDL creates a single HTTP service and thus should expect a single URL assignment. URL should be in format of `<uniqueid>.provider.<provider-domain-name>`

**PRIVATE SERVICE VALIDATION**

* _**Description**_ - ensure a service that does not have `global: true` specification in the `expose\to` stanza is only reachable to specified services of the same SDL.

* _**Expected Outcome**_ - referenced SDL should create a service with no node port assignment that should only be reachable inside the Kubernetes cluster and only to services it is explicitly exposed to. In the SDL tested only the `bind` service should have access to the `pg` service.

#### Expected Failure

**MISALIGNMENT/INCONSISTENT SERVICE NAMES**

* _**Description**_ - service name mismatch in the declaration within the `services` stanza and the use of the service in the `deployment` stanza
* [Current SDL](https://github.com/akash-network/provider/blob/f13aca40ac42f96b80ec5e863cdfa20093e23b44/testdata/sdl/deployment-svc-mismatch.yaml) - `deployment-svc-mismatch.yaml`
* _**Expected Outcome**_ - referenced SDL names the service `web` in the `services` stanza but references the service with the name `webapp` in the \`deployment stanza. The misalignment of service name between stanzas should result in a validation failure during deployment creation transaction send.
