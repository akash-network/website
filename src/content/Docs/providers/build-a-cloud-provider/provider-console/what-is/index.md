# Provider Console

The **Provider Console** (previously known as Praetor App) simplifies the process of becoming a cloud provider on the Akash Network. Instead of using a Command-line Interface, you can manage everything through our intuitive graphical interface. Once set up as a provider, deployers who select your services will compensate you in **AKT**.

## Features

### Multi-Server Support

With **Provider Console**, you can offer a single server or multiple servers, supporting a variety of operating systems, including **Ubuntu, Debian, and CentOS**.

### Kubernetes Integration

Do you have underutilized Kubernetes resources? You can seamlessly integrate them with the Akash Network using **Provider Console**. The tool assists in configuring your existing Kubernetes setup for Akash Network compatibility and initiates the **Provider Service**, enabling you to accept bids and manifests.
