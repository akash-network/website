## STEP 1 - Prerequisites of an Akash Provider

> _**NOTE**_ - the commands in this section and in all remaining sections of this guide assume that the `root` user is used. For ease we suggest using the `root` user for the Kubernetes and Akash Provider install. If a non-root user is used instead, minor command adjustments may be necessary such as using `sudo` command prefixes and updating the home directory in command syntaxes.

### Akash Wallet

Placing a bid on an order requires a 0.5 AKT deposit placed into collateral per bid won. If the provider desired 2 concurrent leases, the providerâ€™s wallet would need minimum funding of 1 AKT.

As every deployment request bid requires 0.5 AKT to be deposited in the escrow account, it's always good to have more so your provider can keep bidding. If your provider is ready to offer 10 deployments, then it's best to have .5 x 10 = 5 AKT and a little more to make sure provider can pay the fees for broadcasting the transactions on Akash Network.

- Recommended amounts:

  - Small providers: 50 AKT total
  - Large providers: 200 AKT total


The steps to create an Akash wallet are covered in the following documentation sections:

- [Install Akash CLI](/docs/deployments/akash-cli/installation/)
- [Create an Account](/docs/deployments/sandbox/installation/)
- [Fund Your Account](/docs/deployments/akash-cli/installation/#fund-your-account)

### **Kubernetes Cluster**

A full Kubernetes cluster is required with outbound internet access and be reachable from the internet.


If you need assistance in building a new cluster, visit the [Kubernetes Cluster for Akash Providers ](/docs/providers/build-a-cloud-provider/kubernetes-cluster-for-akash-providers/kubernetes-cluster-for-akash-providers/)guide.

### RPC Node

Akash Providers need to run their own blockchain RPC node to remove dependence on public nodes. This is a strict requirement.&#x20;

We have recently released documentation guiding thru the process of building a [RPC node via Helm Charts](/docs/akash-nodes/akash-node-via-helm-chart/) with state sync.

### CPU Support

Only x86_64 processors are officially supported by Akash for provider Kubernetes nodes at this time. This may change in the future and when ARM processors are supported it will be announced and documented.

### Custom Kubernetes Cluster Settings

Akash Providers are deployed in many environments and we will make additions to these sections as when nuances are discovered.

### Disable Search Domains

#### Overview

In this section we perform the following DNS adjustments:

##### Set Use Domains to False

- Set `use-domains: false` to prevent the possibility of systemd's DHCP client overwriting the DNS search domain. This prevents a potentially bad domain served by the DHCP server from becoming active.
- This is a common issue to some of the providers which is explained in more detail [here](https://github.com/akash-network/support/issues/80)

##### Set Accept RA to False

- Set `accept-ra: false` to disable IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) as the DNS search domain may still leak through if not disabled.
- Potential issue this addresses is explained in more detail [here](https://bugs.launchpad.net/netplan/+bug/1858503)

#### Create Netplan

> _**NOTE**_ - the DNS resolution issue & the Netplan fix addressed in this step are described [here](https://github.com/akash-network/support/issues/80)

Apply the following to all Kubernetes control plane and worker nodes.

> _**IMPORTANT**_ - Make sure you do not have any other config files under the `/etc/netplan` directory, otherwise it could cause unexpected networking issues / issues with booting up your node.

> If you aren't using the DHCP or want to add additional configuration, please refer to the netplan documentation [here](https://netplan.readthedocs.io/en/stable/netplan-yaml/) for additional config options.

**Example**

- File: `/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml`

> Note that this is only an example of the netplan configuration file to show you how to disable the DNS search domain overriding and IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA). Do not blindly copy the entire config but rather use it as a reference for your convenience!

```
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    all:
      match:
        name: en*
      dhcp4: yes
      dhcp4-overrides:
        use-domains: false
      # disable accept-ra, otherwise it will bring search domains to your /etc/resolv.conf
      # refs https://bugs.launchpad.net/netplan/+bug/1858503
      accept-ra: false
      optional: true
```

#### Test and Apply Netplan

Test the Netplan config and apply via these commands.

```
resolvectl domain
netplan try
netplan apply
resolvectl domain
```

##### Expected/Example Output

```
root@ip-172-31-18-188:~# resolvectl domain
Global:
Link 2 (eth0): us-east-2.compute.internal
root@ip-172-31-18-188:~# netplan try
Do you want to keep these settings?


Press ENTER before the timeout to accept the new configuration


Changes will revert in 111 seconds
Configuration accepted.
root@ip-172-31-18-188:~# netplan apply
root@ip-172-31-18-188:~# resolvectl domain
Global:
Link 2 (eth0): us-east-2.compute.internal
```

## STEP 2 - Kubernetes Configurations

Create Provider namespaces on your Kubernetes cluster.

Run these commands from a Kubernetes control plane node which has kubectl access to cluster.

```
kubectl create ns akash-services
kubectl label ns akash-services akash.network/name=akash-services akash.network=true

kubectl create ns lease
kubectl label ns lease akash.network=true
```

## STEP 3 - Export Provider Wallet

In this section we will export the pre-existing, funded wallet to store the private key in a local file. To conduct the commands in this section the Akash CLI must be installed which is detailed in this [guide ](/docs/deployments/akash-cli/installation/)(STEP 1 only).

The wallet used will be used for the following purposes:

- Pay for provider transaction gas fees
- Pay for bid collateral which is discussed further in this section

> Make sure to create a new Akash account for the provider and do not reuse an account used for deployment purposes. Bids will not be generated from your provider if the deployment orders are created with the same key as the provider.

### List Available Keys

- Print the key names available in the local OS keychain for use in the subsequent step

```
provider-services keys list
```

#### Example/Expected Output

> _**NOTE**_ - in this example the provider key name is `default` and this key name will be used in the subsequent sections of this documentation. Please adjust the key nane as necessary to suit your needs and preferences.

```
provider-services keys list
- name: ""
  type: local
  address: akash1<redacted>
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"<redacted>"}'
  mnemonic: ""
- name: default
  type: local
  address: akash1<redacted>
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"<redacted>"}'
  mnemonic: ""
```

### **Export Private Key to Local File**

- The key-name can be any name of your choice
- Note the passphrase used to protect the private key as it will be used in future steps

> _**NOTE**_ - The passhprase MUST be at least 8 characters long. Otherwise provider will encounter `failed to decrypt private key: ciphertext decryption failed error` when `keys import` is executed.

#### STEP 1 - Export Provider Key

```
cd ~

provider-services keys export default
```

##### Expected/Example Output

```
provider-services keys export default

Enter passphrase to encrypt the exported key:
Enter keyring passphrase:
-----BEGIN TENDERMINT PRIVATE KEY-----
kdf: bcrypt
salt: REDACTED
type: secp256k1

REDACTED
-----END TENDERMINT PRIVATE KEY-----
```

#### &#x20;STEP 2 - Create key.pem and Copy Output Into File

- Create a `key.pem` file

```
cd ~

vim key.pem
```

- Copy the output of the prior command (`provider-services keys export default`) into the `key.pem` file

> _**NOTE -**_ file should contain only what's between `-----BEGIN TENDERMINT PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END TENDERMINT PRIVATE KEY-----` (including the `BEGIN` and `END` lines):

##### Example/Expected File Contents

```
cat key.pem
-----BEGIN TENDERMINT PRIVATE KEY-----
kdf: bcrypt
salt: REDACTED
type: secp256k1

REDACTED
-----END TENDERMINT PRIVATE KEY-----
```

## STEP 4 - Helm Installation on Kubernetes Node

#### Install Helm on a Kubernetes Master Node

```
wget https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.11.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz

tar -zxvf helm-v3.11.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz

install linux-amd64/helm /usr/local/bin/helm

###Remove any potential prior repo instances
helm repo remove akash

helm repo add akash https://akash-network.github.io/helm-charts
```

#### **Confirmation of Helm Install**

**Print Helm Version**

```
helm version
```

**Expected Output**

```
# helm version

version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.11.0", GitCommit:"472c5736ab01133de504a826bd9ee12cbe4e7904", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.18.10"}
```

## Step 5 - Domain Name Review

#### Overview

Add DNS (type A) records for your Akash Provider related domains on your DNS hosting provider.

#### Akash Provider Domain Records

- Replace yourdomain.com with your own domain name
- DNS (type A) records should point to public IP address of a single Kubernetes worker node of your choice

```
*.ingress.yourdomain.com

provider.yourdomain.com
```

> _**NOTE**_ - do not use Cloudflare or any other TLS proxy solution for your Provider DNS A records.

> _**NOTE**_ - Instead of the multiple DNS A records for worker nodes, consider using CNAME DNS records such as the example provided below. CNAME use allows ease of management and introduces higher availability.
>
> \
> `*.ingress 300 IN CNAME nodes.yourdomain.com.`\
> `nodes 300 IN A x.x.x.x`\
> `nodes 300 IN A x.x.x.x`\
> `nodes 300 IN A x.x.x.x`\
> `provider 300 IN CNAME nodes.yourdomain.com.`

#### Example DNS Configuration

## Step 6 - Hostname Operator Build

- Run the following command to build the Kubernetes hostname operator
- Note - if a need arises to use a different software version other than the one defined in the Chart.yaml Helm file - include the following switch. In most circumstances this should not be necessary.
  - `--set image.tag=<image-name>`
  - Example: `--set image.tag=0.1.0`

```
helm install akash-hostname-operator akash/akash-hostname-operator -n akash-services
```

##### Expected/Example Output

```
NAME: akash-hostname-operator
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Apr 28 19:06:30 2022
NAMESPACE: akash-services
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
1. Get the application URL by running these commands:
  export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace akash-services -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=hostname-operator,app.kubernetes.io/instance=hostname-operator" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  export CONTAINER_PORT=$(kubectl get pod --namespace akash-services $POD_NAME -o jsonpath="{.spec.containers[0].ports[0].containerPort}")
  echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use your application"
  kubectl --namespace akash-services port-forward $POD_NAME 8080:$CONTAINER_PORT
```

### **Hostname Operator Confirmation**

```
kubectl get pods -n akash-services
```

##### **Expected output (pod mame will differ)**

```
root@node1:~# kubectl get pods -n akash-services

NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
akash-hostname-operator-84977c6fd9-qvnsm   1/1     Running   0          3m29s
```

## STEP 7 - Inventory Operator Install

_**NOTE**_ - the Inventory Operator is now required on ALL Akash Providers. Previously this operator was only required when the Provider hosted persistent storage. But the operator is now mandated on all providers.

```
helm install inventory-operator akash/akash-inventory-operator -n akash-services
```

##### Expected Output

```
root@node1:~/helm-charts/charts# helm install inventory-operator akash/akash-inventory-operator -n akash-services

NAME: inventory-operator
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu May  5 18:15:57 2022
NAMESPACE: akash-services
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```

### **Inventory Operator Confirmation**

```
kubectl get pods -n akash-services -o wide
```

##### **Expected output (pod names will differ)**

> _**NOTE**_ - a pod should exist for the Inentory Operator itself (I.e. `operator-inventory-7d97d54b7f-sjz5v` in the example below) and one Hardware Discovery pod per Kubernetes host.

```
root@node1:~# kubectl get pods -n akash-services -o wide
NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP               NODE    NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
operator-hostname-84875c8df7-rzfct            1/1     Running   0          4m31s   10.233.71.2      node3   <none>           <none>
operator-inventory-7d97d54b7f-sjz5v           1/1     Running   0          3m54s   10.233.75.2      node2   <none>           <none>
operator-inventory-hardware-discovery-node1   1/1     Running   0          3m49s   10.233.102.131   node1   <none>           <none>

```

## STEP 8 - Provider Build via Helm Chart

#### **Overview**

In this section the Akash Provider will be installed and customized via the use of Helm Charts.

> _**NOTE**_ - when the Helm Chart is installed the Provider instance/details will be created on the blockchain and your provider will be registered in the Akash open cloud marketplace. The associated transaction for Provider creation is detailed [here](/docs/akash-nodes/akash-node-via-helm-chart/).

#### **Environment Variables**

- Declare the following environment variables for Helm use
- Replace the variables with your own settings

1. Set akash provider address that starts with `akash1`

> This allows the akash-provider to decrypt the key

```
export ACCOUNT_ADDRESS=akash1XXXX
```

2\. Set the password you have entered upon akash keys export > key.pem

```
export KEY_PASSWORD='12341234'
```

3\. Set your domain. Register DNS A and wildcard address as specified in previous step, i.e. `provider.test.com` DNS A record and `*.ingress.test.com` DNS wildcard record.

> Domain should be a publicly accessible DNS name dedicated for your provider use such as test.com.
>
> The domain specified in this variable will be used by Helm during the Provider chart install process to produce the "provider.yourdomain.com" sub-domain name and the "ingress.yourdomain.com" sub-domain name. The domain specified will also be used by Helm during the Ingress Controller install steps coming up in this guide. Once your provider is up and running the \*.ingress.yourdomain.com URI will be used for web app deployments such as abc123.ingress.yourdomain.com.

```
export DOMAIN=test.com
```

4\. Set the Akash RPC node for your provider to use

- If you are going to deploy Akash RPC Node using Helm-Charts then set the node to http://akash-node-1:26657 It is recommended that you install your own Akash RPC node. Follow [this guide](/docs/akash-nodes/akash-node-via-helm-chart/) to do so.

> \
> Ensure that the RPC node utilized is in sync prior to proceeding with the provider build.\
> \
> _**NOTE**_ - in the example provided below the NODE variable is set to `akash-node-1` which is the Kubernetes service name of the RPC node when installed via Helm. Use `kubectl get svc -n akash-services` to confirm the service name and status.

```
export NODE=http://akash-node-1:26657
```

#### **Provider Withdraw Period**

- Akash providers may dictate how often they withdraw funds consumed by active deployments/tenants escrow accounts
- Few things to consider regarding the provider withdraw period:
  - The default withdraw setting in the Helm Charts is one (1) hour
  - An advantage of the one hour default setting is assurance that a deployment may not breach the escrow account dramatically. If the withdraw period were set to 12 hours instead - the deployment could exhaust the amount in escrow in one hour (for example) but the provider would not calculate this until many hours later and the deployment would essentially operate for free in the interim.
  - A disadvantage of frequent withdraws is the possibility of losing profitability based on fees incurred by the providers withdraw transactions. If the provider hosts primarily low resource workloads, it is very possible that fees could exceed deployment cost/profit.

##### OPTIONAL - Update the Provider Withdraw Period

- If it is desired to change the withdrawal period from the default one hour setting, update the `withdrawalperiod` setting in the provider.yaml file created subsequently in this section.
- In the example the Provider Build section of this doc the withdrawal period has been set to 12 hours. Please adjust as preferred.

#### **Provider Build Prep**

- Ensure you are applying the latest version of subsequent Helm Charts install/upgrade steps

```
helm repo update
```

##### Create a provider.yaml File

- Issue the following command to build your Akash Provider
- Update the following keys for your unique use case
  - `region`
  - `organization`
- Optional Parameters - the following parameters may be added at the same level as `from` and `key` if you which to advertise your support email address and company website URL. (NOTE: These are not "attributes" but rather informational fields; add them as in the example below)
  - `email`
  - `website`

```
cd ~

mkdir provider

cd provider

cat > provider.yaml << EOF
---
from: "$ACCOUNT_ADDRESS"
key: "$(cat ~/key.pem | openssl base64 -A)"
keysecret: "$(echo $KEY_PASSWORD | openssl base64 -A)"
domain: "$DOMAIN"
node: "$NODE"
withdrawalperiod: 12h
attributes:
  - key: region
    value: "<YOUR REGION>"   # set your region here, e.g. "us-west"
  - key: host
    value: akash
  - key: tier
    value: community
  - key: organization
    value: "<YOUR ORG>"      # set your organization name here
email: <YOUR EMAIL>          # set your email here
website: <YOUR SITE>         # set your website (if you have)
EOF
```

##### **Example provider.yaml File Creation**

```
root@linux-server ~ % cat > provider.yaml << EOF
---
from: "$ACCOUNT_ADDRESS"
key: "$(cat ~/key.pem | openssl base64 -A)"
keysecret: "$(echo $KEY_PASSWORD | openssl base64 -A)"
domain: "$DOMAIN"
node: "$NODE"
withdrawalperiod: 12h
attributes:
  - key: region
    value: us-east
  - key: host
    value: akash
  - key: tier
    value: community
  - key: organization
    value: myorganization
email: your@email.com
website: yoursite.com
EOF
```

#### Verification of provider.yaml File

- Issue the following commands to verify the `provider.yaml` file created in previous steps

```
cd ~/provider

cat provider.yaml
```

##### Example provider.yaml Verification Output

- Ensure there are no empty values

```
from: akash1<REDACTED>
key: LS0tLS1CRU<REDACTED>0tLS0tCg==
keysecret: QUtB<REDACTED>XIK
domain: test.com
node: http://<rpc-address>:26657
withdrawalperiod: 12h
attributes:
- key: region
  value: us-east
- key: host
  value: akash
- key: tier
  value: community
- key: organization
  value: mycompany
email: your@email.com
website: yoursite.com
```

#### **Provider Bid Defaults**

- When a provider is created the default bid engine settings are used. If desired these settings could be updated and added to the `provider.yaml` file. But we would recommend initially using the default values.
- Note - the `bidpricestoragescale` value will get overridden by `-f provider-storage.yaml` covered in [Provider Persistent Storage](/docs/providers/build-a-cloud-provider/helm-based-provider-persistent-storage-enablement/) documentation.

- Note - if you want to use a shellScript bid price strategy, pass the bid price script via `bidpricescript` variable detailed in the [bid pricing script doc](/docs/providers/build-a-cloud-provider/akash-provider-bid-pricing-calculation/). This will automatically suppress all `bidprice<cpu|memory|endpoint|storage>scale` settings.


```
bidpricecpuscale: "0.004" # cpu pricing scale in uakt per millicpu
bidpricememoryscale: "0.0016" # memory pricing scale in uakt per megabyte
bidpriceendpointscale: "0" # endpoint pricing scale in uakt per endpoint
bidpricestoragescale: "0.00016" # storage pricing scale in uakt per megabyte
```

#### **Provider CRD Installations**

- Kubernetes CRDs are no longer delivered by the Helm as of chart `v4.3.0`.
- CRDs are now installed manually using this step.

> _**NOTE**_ - You do not need to run this command if you previously installed the Akash Provider and are now performing an upgrade.

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akash-network/provider/v0.6.4/pkg/apis/akash.network/crd.yaml
```

#### **Install the Provider Helm Chart**

```
helm install akash-provider akash/provider -n akash-services -f provider.yaml
```

##### **Expected Output of Provider Helm Install**

```
NAME: akash-provider
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Apr 28 18:58:10 2022
NAMESPACE: akash-services
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```

#### **Provider Confirmation**

```
kubectl get pods -n akash-services
```

##### **Expected output (example and name following akash-provider will differ)**

```
root@node1:~# kubectl get pods -n akash-services

NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
akash-provider-6d7c455dfb-qkf5z   1/1     Running   0          4m37s
```

##### Troubleshooting

If your Akash Provider pod status displays `init:0/1` for a prolonged period of time, use the following command to view Init container logs. Often the Provider may have a RPC issue and this should be revealed in these logs. RPC issues may be caused by an incorrect declaration in the NODE variable declaration issued previously in this section. Or possibly your custom RPC node is not in sync.

```
kubectl -n akash-services logs -l app=akash-provider -c init --tail 200 -f
```

#### Helm Chart Uninstall Process

- Should a need arise to uninstall the Helm Chart and attempt the process anew, the following step can be used
- Only conduct this step if there is a problem with Akash Provider Helm Chart install
- This Helm uninstall technique can be used for this or any subsequent chart installs
- Following this step - if needed - start the Provider Helm Chart install anew via the prior step in this page

```
helm uninstall akash-provider -n akash-services
```

## STEP 9 - Provider Bid Customization

#### Overview

> _**NOTE**_ - if you are updating your provider bid script from a previous version use this [bid script migration guide](../../../../docs/providers/provider-faq-and-guide/#gpu-provider-troubleshooting).


- If there is a desire to manipulate the provider bid engine, include the `--set bidpricescript` switch . The pricing script used in this switch is detailed in the [Akash Provider Bid Pricing](/docs/providers/build-a-cloud-provider/akash-provider-bid-pricing-calculation/) section of this guide.

- **Note -** When the provider deployment is created the bid script should return the price in under 5 seconds . If the script does not execute in this time period the following error message will be seen in the provider pod logs. Such a report would suggest that there is an error/issue with script customizations that should be reviewed. Following review and adjustment, uninstall the provider deployment (via helm uninstall) and reinstall.
- **Note** - there is further discussion on the bid script and deployer address whitelisting in this [section](#step-11---firewall-rule-review).

> _**USDC Stable Payment Support**_ - note that the current, default bid script enables stable payment support on the Akash Provider. Akash deployments using stable payments are taxed at a slightly higher rate than deployments using AKT payment. If you choose not to support stable payments on your provider, remove stable payment support from the default bid script.

#### Provider Bid Script Customization Steps

##### STEP 1 - Update provider.yaml File

- If customization of your provider bid pricing is desired, begin by updating the `provider.yaml` file which will be used to hold customized values

```
cd ~/provider

vim provider.yaml
```

##### **STEP 2 - Customize** the provider.yaml File

> Update your `provider.yaml` file with the price targets you want. If you don't specify these keys, the bid price script will default values shown below

`price_target_gpu_mappings` sets the GPU price in the following way and in the example provided:

- `a100` nvidia models will be charged by `120` USD/GPU unit a month
- `t4` nvidia models will be charged by `80` USD/GPU unit a month
- Unspecified nvidia models will be charged `130` USD/GPU unit a month (if `*` is not explicitly set in the mapping it will default to `100` USD/GPU unit a month)
- Extend with more models your provider is offering if necessary with syntax of `<model>=<USD/GPU unit a month>`

```
price_target_cpu: 1.60
price_target_memory: 0.80
price_target_hd_ephemeral: 0.02
price_target_hd_pers_hdd: 0.01
price_target_hd_pers_ssd: 0.03
price_target_hd_pers_nvme: 0.04
price_target_endpoint: 0.05
price_target_ip: 5
price_target_gpu_mappings: "a100=120,t4=80,*=130"
```

##### STEP 3 - Download Bid Price Script

```
cd ~/provider

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akash-network/helm-charts/main/charts/akash-provider/scripts/price_script_generic.sh
```

##### STEP 4 - Upgrade akash-provider Deployment with Customized Bid Script

```
helm upgrade akash-provider akash/provider -n akash-services -f provider.yaml  --set bidpricescript="$(cat price_script_generic.sh | openssl base64 -A)"
```

###### Verification of Bid Script Update

```
helm list -n akash-services | grep akash-provider
```

###### Expected/Example Output

```
# helm list -n akash-services | grep akash-provider
akash-provider         	akash-services	28      	2023-09-19 12:25:33.880309778 +0000 UTC	deployed	provider-6.0.5                	0.4.6
```

## STEP 10 - Ingress Controller Install

#### Create Upstream Ingress-Nginx Config

Create the `ingress-nginx-custom.yaml` file via this step

> _**NOTE**_ - in the default install the dedicated Akash RPC Node used for your provider is reachable only within the Kubernetes cluster. This is done intentionally as this RPC Node is intended for use only by the Akash Provider only. The Provider will have access within the cluster to the RPC Node. This additionally protects the RPC Node from possible DDoS attacks from external parties. If have a need to expose the Provider's RPC Node to the outside world, use the `ingress-nginx-custom.yaml` file included in this [section](#step-8---provider-build-via-helm-chart) instead.

```
cd ~

cat > ingress-nginx-custom.yaml << EOF
controller:
  service:
    type: ClusterIP
  ingressClassResource:
    name: "akash-ingress-class"
  kind: DaemonSet
  hostPort:
    enabled: true
  admissionWebhooks:
    port: 7443
  config:
    allow-snippet-annotations: false
    compute-full-forwarded-for: true
    proxy-buffer-size: "16k"
  metrics:
    enabled: true
  extraArgs:
    enable-ssl-passthrough: true
tcp:
  "8443": "akash-services/akash-provider:8443"
  "8444": "akash-services/akash-provider:8444"
EOF
```

##### Expose RPC Node to Outside World

Use this step only if you choose to expose your Akash Provider RPC Node to the outside world

```
cd ~

cat > ingress-nginx-custom.yaml << EOF
controller:
  service:
    type: ClusterIP
  ingressClassResource:
    name: "akash-ingress-class"
  kind: DaemonSet
  hostPort:
    enabled: true
  admissionWebhooks:
    port: 7443
  config:
    allow-snippet-annotations: false
    compute-full-forwarded-for: true
    proxy-buffer-size: "16k"
  metrics:
    enabled: true
  extraArgs:
    enable-ssl-passthrough: true
tcp:
  "1317": "akash-services/akash-node-1:1317"
  "8443": "akash-services/akash-provider:8443"
  "8444": "akash-services/akash-provider:8444"
  "9090":  "akash-services/akash-node-1:9090"
  "26656": "akash-services/akash-node-1:26656"
  "26657": "akash-services/akash-node-1:26657"
EOF
```

#### Install Upstream Ingress-Nginx

```
helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx

helm upgrade --install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx \
  --version 4.12.0 \
  --namespace ingress-nginx --create-namespace \
  -f ingress-nginx-custom.yaml
```

#### Apply Necessary Labels

- Label the `ingress-nginx` namespace and the `akash-ingress-class` ingressclass

```
kubectl label ns ingress-nginx app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx app.kubernetes.io/instance=ingress-nginx

kubectl label ingressclass akash-ingress-class akash.network=true
```

## Step 11 - Firewall Rule Review

#### External/Internet Firewall Rules

The following firewall rules are applicable to internet-facing Kubernetes components.

##### **Akash Provider**

```
8443/tcp - for manifest uploads
```

##### **Ingress Controller**

```
80/tcp - for web app deployments
443/tcp - for web app deployments
30000-32767/tcp - for Kubernetes node port range for deployments
30000-32767/udp - for Kubernetes node port range for deployments
```

## Step 12 - Disable Unattended Upgrades

#### Overview

Unattended upgrades can bring all sorts of uncertainty/troubles such as updates of NVIDIA drivers and have the potential to affects your Provider/K8s cluster. Impact of unattended upgrades can include:

- `nvidia-smi` will hang on the host/pod
- `nvdp plugin` will become stuck and hence K8s cluster will run in a non-desired state where closed deployments will be stuck in `Terminating` status

#### Disable Unattended Upgrades

To disable unattended upgrades, execute these two commands on your Kubernetes worker & control plane nodes:\

```
echo -en 'APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "0";\nAPT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "0";\n' | tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades

apt remove unattended-upgrades

systemctl stop unattended-upgrades.service
systemctl mask unattended-upgrades.service
```

#### Verify

These commands should output `0` following the disable of unattended upgrades. Conduct these verifications your Kubernetes worker & control plane nodes:

```
apt-config dump APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade

apt-config dump APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists
```

##### Example/Expected Output

```
# apt-config dump APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade
APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "0";

# apt-config dump APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists
APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "0";
```

## STEP 13 - Provider Whitelisting (Optional)

#### Overview

- Akash Provider deployment address Whitelist functionality is now enabled in the bid price script
- To use it simply specify the list via whitelist_url attribute as detailed in this section
- Complete the steps in this section to enable/customize Akash Provider Whitelisting

#### Update the Akash Helm-Charts Repo

```
helm repo update akash
```

#### Verify Akash/Provider Helm Chart is 4.3.4 Version or Higher

```
helm search repo akash/provider
```

###### Expected/Example Output

```
# helm search repo akash/provider
NAME              CHART VERSION    APP VERSION    DESCRIPTION
akash/provider    4.3.4            0.4.6          Installs an Akash provider (required)
```

#### Download Bid Price Script Which Supports Whitelisting

> _**USDC Stable Payment Support**_ - note that the current, default bid script downloaded in this step enables stable payment support on the Akash Provider. Akash deployments using stable payments are taxed at a slightly higher rate than deployments using AKT payment. If you choose not to support stable payments on your provider, remove stable payment support from the default bid script.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akash-network/helm-charts/main/charts/akash-provider/scripts/price_script_generic.sh
```

#### Prepare the Whitelist

- Example whitelist hosted on GitHub Gist can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/andy108369/1fa6cfa81674bce438a450d6c14395ea)

### Specify the Bid Price Script and Whitelist URL

> _**NOTE**_ - Whitelist will only work when `bidpricescript` is also set.\
> _**NOTE**_ - You need to specify the direct link to the whitelit (with Github Gist you need to click Raw button to get it)

```
helm upgrade --install akash-provider akash/provider -n akash-services -f provider.yaml \
--set bidpricescript="$(cat /root/provider/price_script_generic.sh | openssl base64 -A)" \
--set whitelist_url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/andy108369/1fa6cfa81674bce438a450d6c14395ea/raw/9181887be8e3e019b58e5dc8e7fce4ae0a66eeec/whitelist.txt
```

## STEP 14 - Extras

#### Force New ReplicaSet Workaround

A known issue exists which occurs when a deployment update is attempted and fails due to the provider being out of resources. This is happens because K8s won't destroy an old pod instance until it ensures the new one has been created.

Follow the steps in the [Force New ReplicaSet Workaround](/docs/providers/provider-faq-and-guide#force-new-replicaset-workaround) document to address this issue.

#### Kill Zombie Processes

A known issue exists which occurs when a tenant creates a deployment which doesn't handle child processes properly, leaving the defunct (aka zombie) proceses behind.
These could potentially occupy all available process slots.

Follow the steps in the [Kill Zombie Processes](/docs/providers/provider-faq-and-guide#kill-zombie-processes) document to address this issue.
