# Provider Playbook Script

The Provider Playbook Script is an automated solution for setting up and configuring Akash providers. It uses Ansible playbooks to streamline the deployment process, making it easier to set up and manage provider infrastructure. The script follows the same principles and configurations as the [Akash CLI provider setup](/docs/providers/build-a-cloud-provider/akash-cli/), automating many of the manual steps involved in the process.
