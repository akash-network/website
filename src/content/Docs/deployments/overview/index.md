Applications can be deployed onto the Akash network using a platform that best suits your needs and preferences. Explore the following guides for your unique use case.

- [Akash Console](/docs/deployments/akash-console/)
- [Using the Command Line for Akash Deployments ](/docs/deployments/akash-cli/installation/)
- [Akash Sandbox Use](/docs/deployments/sandbox/introduction/)
- [Awesome Akash Example Distributed Applications](/docs/deployments/apps-on-akash/)
- [Provider Console](/docs/providers/build-a-cloud-provider/provider-console/what-is/)

## Best Practices

### Image Declaration

- Avoid using `:latest` image tags as Akash Providers heavily cache images
- Additional info on related SDL declarations is available [here](/docs/getting-started/stack-definition-language/)
