- [Cloudmos Deploy (web app)](/docs/deployments/cloudmos-deploy/)
- [Using the Command Line for Akash Deployments ](/docs/deployments/akash-cli/installation/)

## Best Practices

### Image Declaration

- Avoid using `:latest` image tags as Akash Providers heavily cache images
- Additional info on related SDL declarations is available [here](https://docs.akash.network/readme/stack-definition-language#services)
