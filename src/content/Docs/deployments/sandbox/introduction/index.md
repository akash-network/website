The Akash Sandbox network is intended for short-term workload testing and for new user experimentation.

The Akash Console sandbox mode allows you to:
- Test deployments without using real AKT tokens
- Experiment with different configurations safely
- Learn Akash deployment processes without financial risk
- Validate your deployment manifests before going live on mainnet

> _**NOTE**_ - sandbox workloads that have been running for more than 24 hours may be taken down. Please only use the sandbox for short duration testing.

The Akash Sandbox version matches the current Mainnet version.

Use the following documentation for sandbox use and depending on your preferred deployment tool.

### Deployment Options

**For GUI Users :**
- [Akash Console for Sandbox](/docs/deployments/sandbox/sandbox-via-console/) - Web-based interface with easy network switching

**For CLI Users :**
- [Akash CLI for Sandbox Use](/docs/deployments/sandbox/installation/) - Command-line interface for deployment creation and management

> _**NOTE**_ - Most users prefer the Akash Console for its ease of use. Simply switch the network from `Mainnet` to `Sandbox` in the Console settings to get started with testing deployments.

## Key Differences from Mainnet

When using sandbox mode, be aware of the following differences:

- **Tokens**: Use test AKT tokens instead of real ones
- **Performance**: May have different performance characteristics than mainnet
- **Providers**: Limited set of test providers available
- **Data**: No persistent data guarantees
