The Akash Console provides an intuitive web interface for deploying and managing workloads on the Akash Network. For features like Authorized Spend, the Console offers a user-friendly way to create and manage spend authorizations.

> _**NOTE**_ - Authorized Spend is only accessible via wallet payments. Make sure you are using the wallet as your payment method and are connected to the console.

2. Hover over the wallet icon on the top right corner of the console
3. You will see the `Authorized Spend` option; click on it (Bank icon)

| Field | Description | Requirements |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Token** | Select the token type for authorization | AKT or USDC |

### Managing Authorizations via Console

#### **Viewing Existing Authorizations**
The Authorizations page displays two sections:
- **Authorizations Given**: List of grants you've created for other wallets
- **Authorizations Received**: List of grants other wallets have given to you

Each authorization shows:
- Grantee/Granter address
- Token type and remaining balance
- Expiration date
- Status indicator (Active/Expired)

#### **Modifying Spending Limits**
To change an existing authorization's spending limit:
1. Find the existing authorization in the "Authorizations Given" list
2. Click the "Edit" Icon from the Actions column
3. You can update the spending limit and expiration date

#### **Revoking Authorizations**
To revoke access:
1. Find the existing authorization in the "Authorizations Given" list
2. Click the "delete" icon from the Actions column
3. Confirm the revocation in the confirmation dialog.

#### **Checking Remaining Authorized Balances**
- The Console automatically calculates remaining balances
- When creating a deployment with authorized funds, the system validates:
  - Grant existence and type
  - Expiration status
  - Sufficient spending limit for the deployment cost
- Remaining balance is displayed in the Authorizations table

## Deploying with Authorized Funds via Console

#### **Deployment Process**
When using authorized funds, the deployment process is as follows:
- From the grantee wallet, navigate to the [Authorizations page](https://console.akash.network/settings/authorizations) to view active authorizations
- The process is the same as a standard deployment
  1. While confirming the deployment, select the `Use another address to Funds` option
  2. Select the appropriate grant from the dropdown list
  3. Complete the deployment process as usual

> _**NOTE**_ - The grantee wallet still needs some minimal, additional AKT to cover gas costs. Alternatively, you can use the transaction fee authorization feature if the funding wallet has sufficient balance.


### Expected User Flow Documentation

1. Log into Console with authorized wallet
2. Create new deployment
3. Select "Use Authorized Funds" option

7. Request limit increases from admin if needed

## Troubleshooting

#### Cannot Access Authorized Spend

- Clear browser cache if issues persist.

#### Authorization Not Working

- Confirm the authorization type is correct (Deployment Authorization)

#### Deployment Failures with Authorized Funds

- Ensure the grantee wallet has sufficient AKT for gas fees
