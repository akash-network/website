**Get set up with the provider-services CLI to deploy on Akash Network.**

This guide walks you through installing the CLI, creating a wallet, and funding your account.

---

## Install provider-services

Select your operating system:

import TabsWrapper, { TabContent } from "@/components/ui/tabs";

<TabsWrapper client:load >
<TabContent  value="MacOS">
   #### MacOS

**Option 1: Using Homebrew (Recommended)**

```
brew tap akash-network/tap
brew install akash-provider-services
```

**Option 2: Download Binary**

```
cd ~/Downloads

# Download the latest release
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akash-network/provider/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Move the Binary**

```
sudo mv ./bin/provider-services /usr/local/bin
```

**Verify Installation**

```
provider-services version
```

**Expected Output**

```
v0.10.0
```

</TabContent>

<TabContent  value="Linux">

**Download and Install Binary**

```
cd ~

# Install dependencies
apt install jq -y
apt install unzip -y

# Download and install provider-services
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akash-network/provider/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Add to Path**

```
vi /etc/environment
```

Add the following to PATH:

```
/root/bin
```

**Make Path Active**

```
. /etc/environment
```

**Verify Installation**

```
provider-services version
```

**Expected Output**

```
v0.10.0
```

  </TabContent>
  <TabContent value="Windows">
  #### Windows

**Using WSL2 (Recommended)**

Install Windows Subsystem for Linux 2, then follow the Linux instructions above.

[Install WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

**Native Windows**

1. Download the latest Windows binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/akash-network/provider/releases)
2. Extract the `.zip` file
3. Move `provider-services.exe` to a directory in your PATH
4. Open PowerShell and verify:

```
provider-services version
```

  </TabContent>
  <TabContent value="Source">
  #### From Source

Installing provider-services from source:

```
$ go get -d github.com/akash-network/provider
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/akash-network/provider
$ AKASH_NET="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akash-network/net/main/mainnet"
$ AKASH_VERSION="$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/akash-network/provider/releases/latest | jq -r '.tag_name')"
$ git checkout "$AKASH_VERSION"
$ make deps-install
$ make install
```

**Requirements:**

- [golang 1.21+](https://golang.org/)
- Properly set `GOPATH`
- `$GOPATH/bin` present in `$PATH`

Once you have the dependencies setup, download and build using `make install`.

**Verify Installation**

```
provider-services version
```

  </TabContent>
  </TabsWrapper>

## Create an Account

Configure the name of your key:

```bash
AKASH_KEY_NAME=my-wallet
```

Verify the variable is set:

```bash
echo $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

Set the keyring backend:

```bash
AKASH_KEYRING_BACKEND=os
```

Create an Akash account:

```bash
provider-services keys add $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

Read the output and **save your mnemonic phrase** in a safe place.

Set your account address as a variable:

```bash
export AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS="$(provider-services keys show $AKASH_KEY_NAME -a)"

echo $AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
```

Note that if you close your Terminal window this variable will not be saved.

---

## Fund your Account

A minimum deposit of 0.5 AKT is required to deploy on Akash. A small transaction fee is also applied to deployment leases.

**Get AKT tokens:**

- [Buying AKT from an exchange / swapping to AKT](https://akash.network/token)
- [Join the Akash Community](https://discord.com/invite/akash)

---

## Configure your Network

Configure the base URL for the Akash Network:

```bash
AKASH_NET="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akash-network/net/main/mainnet"
```

### Version

```bash
AKASH_VERSION="$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/akash-network/provider/releases/latest | jq -r '.tag_name')"
```

### Chain ID

```bash
export AKASH_CHAIN_ID="$(curl -s "$AKASH_NET/chain-id.txt")"
```

### Network Node

```bash
export AKASH_NODE="$(curl -s "$AKASH_NET/rpc-nodes.txt" | shuf -n 1)"
```

### Confirm Network Variables

```bash
echo $AKASH_NODE $AKASH_CHAIN_ID $AKASH_KEYRING_BACKEND
```

You should see something similar to:

`http://135.181.60.250:26657 akashnet-2 os`

### Set Additional Environment Variables

| Variable             | Description                                               | Recommended Value |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| AKASH_GAS            | Gas limit to set per-transaction                          | `auto`            |
| AKASH_GAS_ADJUSTMENT | Adjustment factor to be multiplied against the estimate   | `1.25`            |
| AKASH_GAS_PRICES     | Gas prices in decimal format to determine transaction fee | `0.025uakt`       |
| AKASH_SIGN_MODE      | Signature mode                                            | `amino-json`      |

```
export AKASH_GAS=auto
export AKASH_GAS_ADJUSTMENT=1.25
export AKASH_GAS_PRICES=0.025uakt
export AKASH_SIGN_MODE=amino-json
```

### Check your Account Balance

```bash
provider-services query bank balances --node $AKASH_NODE $AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
```

You should see a response similar to:

```
balances:
- amount: "93000637"
  denom: uakt
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

**Note:** Balance is denominated in uAKT (AKT x 10^-6). In the example above, the account has a balance of _93 AKT_.

Your account must have a minimum balance of 0.5 AKT to create a deployment.

## Authentication

Akash provider services support two authentication methods:

### JWT Authentication (Default - Recommended)

**JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** is the default and recommended authentication method for provider-services v0.10.0+.

**Advantages:**
- No blockchain transactions required
- No certificate expiration to manage
- Simpler setup
- No additional costs

**JWT tokens are automatically generated and managed by provider-services CLI.** No setup required!

When you run deployment commands, the CLI automatically:
1. Signs requests with your account's private key
2. Creates JWT tokens
3. Sends authenticated requests to providers

**You're ready to deploy!** Jump to [Next Steps](#next-steps).

---

### mTLS Certificate Authentication (Optional)

**mTLS (mutual TLS)** certificates are an alternative authentication method.

**When to use mTLS:**
- You require certificate-based authentication
- You're integrating with systems that require X.509 certificates
- You prefer blockchain-stored credentials

#### Generate Certificate

```
provider-services tx cert generate client --from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

Note: If it errors with `Error: certificate error: cannot overwrite certificate`, add `--overwrite` flag.

#### Publish Certificate to Blockchain

```
provider-services tx cert publish client --from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

**Certificate Notes:**
- Certificates cost transaction fees (~0.01 AKT)
- Valid for one year, then must be renewed
- Stored on the Akash blockchain
- Can be revoked and regenerated

## Next Steps

Now that you're set up, you can:

- [**CLI Configuration**](/docs/developers/deployment/cli/configuration) - Configure networks and advanced settings
- [**CLI Commands Reference**](/docs/developers/deployment/cli/commands-reference) - Learn all available commands
- [**Core Concepts**](/docs/getting-started/core-concepts) - Understand how Akash works

## Troubleshooting

### "command not found: provider-services"

The binary isn't in your PATH. Try:

```bash
# Find where it's installed
which provider-services

# Add to PATH (Linux/macOS)
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/provider-services
```

### "account not found"

Your wallet hasn't been created or funded yet. Go back to [Create an Account](#create-an-account) and [Fund your Account](#fund-your-account).

### "insufficient fees"

Increase your gas prices:

```bash
export AKASH_GAS_PRICES=0.05uakt
```

### RPC Node Issues

If the default RPC node is down, try an alternative:

```bash
export AKASH_NODE=https://rpc.akash.forbole.com:443
# or
export AKASH_NODE=https://akash-rpc.polkachu.com:443
```
