**Welcome to Akash Node Operations!**

Choose your path: run a full node to interact with the blockchain, or become a validator to secure the network and earn rewards.

---

## What Do You Want to Run?

### Full Node

**Purpose:** Interact with the blockchain, run your own RPC/API endpoints, and support network decentralization.

**Requirements:**
- CPU: 4-8 cores
- Memory: 16-32 GB RAM
- Storage: 512 GB SSD (1 TB+ recommended)
- No AKT required

**Next Step:** [Node Build Guides](/docs/node-operators/node-build)

---

### Validator

**Purpose:** Secure the network, validate transactions, and earn staking rewards.

**Requirements:**
- CPU: 8+ cores (16 recommended)
- Memory: 128 GB RAM
- Storage: 1 TB NVMe SSD
- Uptime: 99.9%+ (slashing for downtime)
- AKT: 10,000+ recommended for active set

**Important:** You **must** run a full node first before becoming a validator.

**Next Steps:**
1. [Build a Full Node](/docs/node-operators/node-build) - Get your node synced
2. [Run a Validator](/docs/node-operators/validators/running-a-validator) - Create your validator

## Active Validator Set

**Current Size:** 100 validators

To join the active set, you need more voting power than the 100th validator.

**Check Requirements:**
- Discord: `$votingpower` in [#validators-status](https://discord.akash.network)
- Explorers: [Mintscan](https://www.mintscan.io/akash/validators) | [ATOMScan](https://atomscan.com/akash/validators)
