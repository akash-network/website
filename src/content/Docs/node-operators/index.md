**Run and operate Akash nodes and validators on the network.**

Akash Network is secured by a decentralized network of validators who stake AKT tokens to produce blocks and validate transactions. Anyone can run a full node to interact with the blockchain, and qualified operators can become validators to earn staking rewards.

## What Can You Do?

### Run a Full Node
- Interact with the blockchain directly
- Support network decentralization
- Run your own RPC/API endpoints
- No AKT staking required
- Lower hardware requirements

### Become a Validator
- Secure the network through consensus
- Earn staking rewards (commission on delegations)
- Join the active validator set (top 100)
- Requires 99.9%+ uptime
- Significant AKT stake required (10,000+ recommended)

## Active Validator Set

**Current Size:** 100 validators

To join the active set, you need more voting power (delegated stake) than the 100th validator. Check current requirements:
- Discord: `$votingpower` in [#validators-status](https://discord.akash.network)
- Explorers: [Mintscan](https://www.mintscan.io/akash/validators) | [ATOMScan](https://atomscan.com/akash/validators)
