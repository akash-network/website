## What is BME?

The **Burn-Mint Equilibrium (BME)** is a new economic mechanism for the Akash Network that introduces a stable compute credit token called **ACT** (Akash Compute Token). ACT is designed to be pegged to ~$1 USD, providing stable pricing for cloud deployments while AKT remains the staking and governance token.

**Key changes with BME:**
- Deployments are now priced and paid in **ACT** (not AKT)
- Users mint ACT by depositing AKT into the vault
- Providers receive ACT for compute, then burn ACT to receive AKT
- A circuit breaker protects the system during extreme market conditions

## Testnet Participation

### Prize Eligibility

To be eligible for prizes, testers must submit **proof of testing** for each completed test:

| Test Type | Required Proof |
|-----------|----------------|
| Query/Read operations | Full query output showing results |
| Transactions (mint, burn, deploy, etc.) | Transaction hash (txhash) |
| State changes | Before AND after query outputs |
| Deployment tests | DSEQ, lease info, and deployment status |

**Example proof for a mint operation:**
```bash
# Transaction hash from mint
akash tx bme mint-act 10000000uakt --from mywallet -y
# Output: {"txhash":"ABC123..."}

# Query showing ACT received
akash query bank balances <your-address>
```

### Submission Form

### Quick Reference

| Parameter | Value |

## Test Guidance

Detailed test steps, expected results, and validation procedures are available here:

**[BME Testnet Test Plan](/docs/testnet/testplan)**

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

```bash
# Configure for testnet-8
export AKASH_CHAIN_ID=testnet-8
export AKASH_NODE=https://testnetrpc.akashnet.net:443
export AKASH_KEYRING_BACKEND=test
export AKASH_GAS=auto
export AKASH_GAS_ADJUSTMENT=1.5
export AKASH_GAS_PRICES=0.025uakt
```

### 2. Get Testnet Tokens

Obtain testnet AKT from the faucet: https://faucet.dev.akash.pub/

### 3. Mint ACT (Required Before Deploying)

```bash
# Mint ACT from AKT
akash tx bme mint-act 10000000uakt --from <wallet> -y

# Wait ~1 minute for epoch processing
sleep 60

# Verify ACT in your balance
akash query bank balances <your-address>
```

### 4. Create a Deployment

```bash
# Ensure your SDL uses uact for pricing
# Example: denom: uact (not uakt)

# Create deployment with ACT deposit
akash tx deployment create deploy.yml --deposit 5000000uact --from <wallet> -y
```

---

## Key BME Commands

### Query Commands

```bash
# Check BME system status
akash query bme status

# Check vault state
akash query bme vault-state

# Check BME parameters
akash query bme params

# Check your token balances
akash query bank balances <your-address>

# Check oracle prices
akash query oracle prices
```

### Transaction Commands

```bash
# Mint ACT from AKT
akash tx bme mint-act <amount>uakt --from <wallet> -y

# Burn ACT to receive AKT
akash tx bme burn-act <amount>uact --from <wallet> -y

# Create deployment (with ACT)
akash tx deployment create <sdl-file> --deposit <amount>uact --from <wallet> -y

# Top up deployment escrow
akash tx escrow deposit deployment <amount>uact --dseq <dseq> --from <wallet> -y

# Close deployment
akash tx deployment close --dseq <dseq> --from <wallet> -y
```

## Important Notes for Testers

1. **Epoch Delays:** ACT minting is epoch-based (~1 minute / 10 blocks). After `mint-act`, wait before checking your balance.

2. **SDL Changes:** Your SDL files must use `uact` for pricing, not `uakt`:
   ```yaml
   profiles:
     compute:
       myservice:
         resources:
           # ...
     placement:
       myplacement:
         pricing:
           myservice:
             denom: uact    # <-- Must be uact, not uakt
             amount: 1000
   ```

3. **Provider Settlement:** Providers receive ACT from deployments, then call `burn-act` to convert to AKT. This is a two-step process.

4. **Circuit Breaker:** If BME status shows `mint_status_halt_cr`, minting new ACT is temporarily blocked. Existing ACT can still be used for deployments.

5. **Document Everything:** For prize eligibility, capture full command outputs including transaction hashes and query results.

## Troubleshooting

### "ACT not appearing after mint"
Wait for epoch (~1 minute), then query again. ACT minting is not instant.

### "denom not supported: uact" from provider
The provider's pricing script needs to be updated to support ACT. Report to testnet admins.

### "insufficient funds" when deploying
Ensure you have ACT (not just AKT). Run `akash query bank balances <address>` to check.

### BME status shows "halt_oracle" or "halt_cr"
The system is in a protected state. Check `akash query bme status` for details. During `halt_cr`, you cannot mint new ACT but can still use existing ACT.
