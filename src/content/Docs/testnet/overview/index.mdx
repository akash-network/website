# BME Testnet Overview

## What is BME?

The **Burn-Mint Equilibrium (BME)** introduces a stable compute credit token called **ACT (Akash Compute Token)**.

ACT is designed to be pegged to approximately **\$1 USD**, providing stable pricing for cloud deployments, while **AKT** remains the staking and governance token.

### Key Changes with BME

- Deployments are priced and paid in **ACT** (not AKT)
- Users mint ACT by depositing AKT into the vault
- Providers receive ACT for compute, then burn ACT to receive AKT
- A circuit breaker protects the system during extreme market conditions

## Testnet Participation

### Prize Eligibility

To be eligible for prizes, testers must submit **proof of testing** for each completed test.

| Test Type | Required Proof |
|------------|----------------|
| Query / Read operations | Full query output showing results |
| Transactions (mint, burn, deploy, etc.) | Transaction hash (`txhash`) |
| State changes | Before **and** after query outputs |
| Deployment tests | DSEQ, lease info, and deployment status |

#### Example Proof for a Mint Operation

```bash
# Transaction hash from mint
akash tx bme mint-act 10000000uakt --from mywallet -y

# Output:
# {"txhash":"ABC123..."}

# Query showing ACT received
akash query bank balances <your-address>
```

## Test Guidance

Detailed test steps, expected results, and validation procedures:

[BME Testnet Test Plan](/docs/testnet/testplan)

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

```bash
export AKASH_CHAIN_ID=testnet-8
export AKASH_NODE=https://testnetrpc.akashnet.net:443
export AKASH_KEYRING_BACKEND=test
export AKASH_GAS=auto
export AKASH_GAS_ADJUSTMENT=1.5
export AKASH_GAS_PRICES=0.025uakt
```

---

### 2. Get Testnet Tokens

Request testnet AKT from:

https://faucet.dev.akash.pub/

---

### 3. Mint ACT (Required Before Deploying)

```bash
akash tx bme mint-act 10000000uakt --from <wallet> -y

# Wait for epoch (~1 minute)
sleep 60

akash query bank balances <your-address>
```

---

### 4. Create a Deployment

Ensure your SDL uses `uact` for pricing (not `uakt`).

```bash
akash tx deployment create deploy.yml \
  --deposit 5000000uact \
  --from <wallet> \
  -y
```

---

## Key BME Commands

### Query Commands

```bash
akash query bme status
akash query bme vault-state
akash query bme params
akash query bank balances <your-address>
akash query oracle prices
```

### Transaction Commands

```bash
akash tx bme mint-act <amount>uakt --from <wallet> -y
akash tx bme burn-act <amount>uact --from <wallet> -y
akash tx deployment create <sdl-file> --deposit <amount>uact --from <wallet> -y
akash tx escrow deposit deployment <amount>uact --dseq <dseq> --from <wallet> -y
akash tx deployment close --dseq <dseq> --from <wallet> -y
```

---

## Important Notes for Testers

1. **Epoch Delays:** ACT minting occurs on epoch boundaries (~1 minute / 10 blocks).
2. **SDL Updates Required:** Pricing must use `uact`.
3. **Provider Settlement:** Providers must call `burn-act` to convert ACT → AKT.
4. **Circuit Breaker:** If status shows `mint_status_halt_cr`, new ACT minting is paused.
5. **Document Everything:** Capture full command output for prize eligibility.

---

## Troubleshooting

### ACT Not Appearing After Mint
Wait for the next epoch (~1 minute), then query balances again.

### "denom not supported: uact"
The provider pricing script must be updated to support ACT.

### "insufficient funds"
Ensure you have ACT, not just AKT.

### System Halt States
Check:

```bash
akash query bme status
```
