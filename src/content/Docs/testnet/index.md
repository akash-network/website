Welcome to the BME (Burn-Mint Equilibrium) testnet documentation. This section contains guides and resources for testing the new ACT (Akash Compute Token) economic mechanism.

## What is BME?

The **Burn-Mint Equilibrium (BME)** is a new economic mechanism that introduces ACT, a stable compute credit token pegged to ~$1 USD. This provides stable pricing for cloud deployments while AKT remains the staking and governance token.
