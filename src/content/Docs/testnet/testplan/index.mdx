## Overview

This test plan validates BME functionality through real user workflows on testnet. Tests are triggered by user actions (creating deployments, closing deployments, funding wallets) rather than direct message invocation. BME mechanics are verified by observing state changes after user actions complete.

## Prerequisites

### Network Health (Verified in Category 0)

The following are validated during Category 0 pre-flight checks. If any issues are found, report them to the Akash Core team via the testnet Discord channel — network health is not the tester's responsibility to fix.

- Healthy testnet-8 network running with BME module enabled
- Oracle module configured with price feeds
- Provider(s) running on testnet to accept deployments

### Tester Requirements

The following are your responsibility to set up before testing:

- **Akash CLI** (`akash`) configured for testnet
  - CLI deployment guide: https://akash.network/docs/developers/deployment/cli/
  - Ensure MTLS certs are installed as covered here: https://akash.network/docs/developers/deployment/cli/installation-guide/#mtls-certificate-authentication-optional
- **Provider Services binary** (`provider-services`) for sending manifests
  - Download from: https://github.com/akash-network/provider/releases
- **Funded test wallet** — use the testnet faucet (https://faucet.dev.akash.pub — 500 AKT per request)

**Note:** All prerequisites are validated in Category 0 pre-flight checks.

## Key Metrics to Monitor

These should be queried before and after each test:

| Metric | Query Method | Description |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| `OutstandingACT` | `akash query bme vault-state` | Total ACT supply (system liabilities) |
| `VaultAKT` | `akash query bme vault-state` | AKT held in BME module account |
| `RemintCredits` | `akash query bme vault-state` | Available AKT credits before new minting required |
| `TotalBurned` | `akash query bme vault-state` | Cumulative ACT burned |
| `TotalMinted` | `akash query bme vault-state` | Cumulative AKT minted (inflationary) |
| `collateral_ratio` | `akash query bme status` | Collateral Ratio (decimal, e.g., 0.99) |
| `status` | `akash query bme status` | Current status (mint_status_healthy/warning/halt_cr/halt_oracle) |
| User AKT Balance | `akash query bank balances <addr>` | User's AKT and ACT |
| Oracle Price | `akash query oracle prices \| head -n 15` | Current AKT/USD price |

## Circuit Breaker Testing Window

Several tests require the Akash Core team to simulate price movements by adjusting the oracle price feeder. These tests cannot be run during normal testnet operation.

The Core team will announce a **dedicated 24-hour circuit breaker testing window** in the testnet Discord channel. The schedule will specify time windows for each state (Warning, HaltCR, HaltOracle, Recovery) so testers know when to run each test.

**Tests requiring the circuit breaker window:**
- Category 6: Circuit Breaker (6.2-6.7)
- Category 7: Dynamic Epoch Timing (7.2-7.3)
- Category 10: End-to-End stress test (10.3)

## Key Implementation Notes

1. **Remint Credits are active** - System tracks credits and uses them before minting new AKT
2. **Two-phase execution** - RequestBurnMint queues operations, executeBurnMint processes them
3. **Four mint statuses** - Healthy, Warning, HaltCR, HaltOracle
4. **Dynamic epoch timing** - Adjusts based on Collateralization Ratio
5. **Asymmetric circuit breaker** - AKT→ACT blocked during halt, ACT→AKT still works
6. **Provider settlement is two-step** - Provider receives ACT, then burns to AKT
7. **SDL pricing must use uact** - Using uakt bypasses BME (known validation gap)
