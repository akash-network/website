These tests validate complete BME workflows across multiple components.

**Note:** Many E2E scenarios are already validated through earlier categories. These tests serve as summary validations.

### Test 10.1: Full Deployment Lifecycle

**Objective:** Validate complete BME flow from mint to burn

**Reference:** This test validates the integration of:
- Category 1: Deployment creation with ACT
- Category 2: Deployment closure and ACT burns
- Category 3: Provider settlement

**User Actions:**
1. Start with fresh wallet funded with AKT (500 AKT from faucet)

2. Mint ACT:
   ```bash
   akash tx bme mint-act 200000000uakt --from <wallet> -y
   sleep 90
   akash query bank balances <wallet>
   ```

3. Create deployment with ACT:
   ```bash
   akash tx deployment create deploy.yml --deposit 50000000uact --from <wallet> -y
   # Complete lease creation and send manifest
   ```

4. Let deployment run (~2-3 minutes)

5. Close deployment:
   ```bash
   akash tx deployment close --dseq <dseq> --from <wallet> -y
   ```

6. Burn remaining ACT:
   ```bash
   akash query bank balances <wallet>  # Note ACT balance
   akash tx bme burn-act <act-balance>uact --from <wallet> -y
   sleep 90
   akash query bank balances <wallet>
   ```

7. Verify final state:
   ```bash
   akash query bme vault-state
   ```

**Expected Results:**
- Full cycle completes without errors
- ACT minted → used for deployment → returned on close → burned to AKT
- Vault state reflects all operations
- Provider received ACT payment

**Proof to Submit:**
- Initial and final AKT balances
- All transaction hashes
- Final vault-state

**Note:** If you've completed Categories 1-3, this test is largely validated. This serves as an integration summary.

### Test 10.2: Multi-User Concurrent Activity

**Objective:** Verify BME handles multiple users operating simultaneously

**User Actions:**

1. Create 2-3 test wallets:
   ```bash
   akash keys add user-a
   akash keys add user-b
   akash keys add user-c
   ```

2. Fund all wallets via faucet (500 AKT each)

3. From separate terminals (or sequentially with short delays), each user mints ACT:
   ```bash
   # Terminal A
   akash tx bme mint-act 100000000uakt --from user-a -y
   
   # Terminal B
   akash tx bme mint-act 100000000uakt --from user-b -y
   
   # Terminal C
   akash tx bme mint-act 100000000uakt --from user-c -y
   ```

4. Wait for epoch:
   ```bash
   sleep 90
   ```

5. Verify all users received ACT:
   ```bash
   akash query bank balances $(akash keys show user-a -a)
   akash query bank balances $(akash keys show user-b -a)
   akash query bank balances $(akash keys show user-c -a)
   ```

6. Check vault state reflects all operations:
   ```bash
   akash query bme vault-state
   ```

**Expected Results:**
- All users successfully mint ACT
- No cross-user interference
- Each user's balance is correct and independent
- Vault state reflects total of all operations (300 AKT minted)
- BME handles concurrent activity correctly

**Proof to Submit:**
- All 3 mint tx hashes
- All 3 user balances showing ACT received
- Vault state showing cumulative 300 AKT in balances.uakt

## Summary

| Test | Objective | Key Verification |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| 10.1 | Full lifecycle | Complete mint→deploy→close→burn cycle |
| 10.2 | Multi-user | Concurrent operations don't interfere |

**Note:** Circuit breaker testing is covered in Category 6. Price volatility scenarios are covered in Category 2 (tests 2.3, 2.4).
