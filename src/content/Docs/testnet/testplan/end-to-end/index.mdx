These tests verify complete user journeys that combine multiple BME operations. They simulate realistic usage patterns and validate end-to-end system behavior.

### Test 10.1: Full Deployment Lifecycle - Happy Path

**Objective:** Complete end-to-end test of typical user journey

**User Actions:**
1. Create new wallet:
   ```bash
   akash keys add e2e-test-wallet
   ```

2. Fund with AKT from faucet (https://faucet.dev.akash.pub)

3. Record all initial BME state:
   ```bash
   akash query bank balances <wallet>
   akash query bme vault-state
   akash query bme status
   ```

4. Mint ACT and create deployment (see Category 1 for full workflow):
   ```bash
   akash tx bme mint-act 200000000uakt --from e2e-test-wallet -y
   sleep 60
   akash tx deployment create deploy.yml --deposit 100000000uact --from e2e-test-wallet -y
   # Complete lease creation and send manifest...
   ```

5. Verify deployment running:
   ```bash
   akash query market lease list --owner <wallet>
   ```

6. Let deployment run for extended period (30-60 minutes)

7. Check vault-state periodically to observe settlements:
   ```bash
   akash query bme vault-state
   ```

8. Close deployment:
   ```bash
   akash tx deployment close --dseq <dseq> --from e2e-test-wallet -y
   ```

9. Wait for epoch and verify refund received:
   ```bash
   sleep 60
   akash query bank balances <wallet>
   ```

10. Reconcile all accounting:
    ```bash
    akash query bme vault-state
    ```

**Expected Results:**
- All steps complete successfully
- RemintCredits accrued on deposits
- RemintCredits used on settlements/refund
- TotalMinted unchanged (if no price drop during test)
- Final AKT balance = Initial - compute_used (at current prices)
- Clean end state with no orphaned resources

**Proof to Submit:**
- Initial and final wallet balances
- Initial and final vault-state
- Deployment create and close tx hashes
- Lease list showing deployment was active

### Test 10.2: Full Lifecycle with Price Volatility

**Objective:** End-to-end test with price movements affecting settlements

**How to Encounter This Scenario:**
This test validates BME behavior across natural price fluctuations. Simply:
1. Create a deployment and note the starting price
2. Let it run for an extended period (hours to days)
3. Close when price has moved in either direction
4. Document what happened — the specific scenario depends on price movement

**User Actions:**
1. Record initial oracle price and timestamp:
   ```bash
   akash query oracle prices | head -n 15
   date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"
   ```
   **Write down P_start.**

2. Create deployment:
   ```bash
   akash tx bme mint-act 200000000uakt --from <wallet> -y
   sleep 60
   akash tx deployment create deploy.yml --deposit 100000000uact --from <wallet> -y
   # Complete lease creation...
   ```

3. Record initial vault-state:
   ```bash
   akash query bme vault-state
   ```

4. Let deployment run for extended period — monitor price periodically:
   ```bash
   akash query oracle prices | head -n 15
   ```
   
5. Observe settlements occurring (vault-state changes over time)

6. After significant time and price movement, close deployment:
   ```bash
   akash tx deployment close --dseq <dseq> --from <wallet> -y
   sleep 60
   ```

7. Reconcile all accounting:
   ```bash
   akash query bank balances <wallet>
   akash query bme vault-state
   akash query bank total --denom uakt
   ```

**Expected Results:**
Document what you observe based on actual price movement:

**If price increased during deployment:**
- Settlements used fewer AKT (higher price = less AKT per ACT)
- Remint credits may have surplus
- Refund returns fewer AKT (but same USD value)
- TotalMinted likely unchanged (deflationary scenario)

**If price decreased during deployment:**
- Settlements required more AKT
- Remint credits may be depleted
- Refund returns more AKT (but same USD value)
- TotalMinted may have increased (inflationary scenario)

**Key Insight:**
- User's final AKT reflects **USD exposure**, not AKT exposure
- The BME mechanism absorbed the price volatility
- System handled price volatility gracefully

**Proof to Submit:**
- P_start and P_end oracle prices
- Initial and final vault-state
- Initial and final wallet balances
- Summary of observed behavior (price up or down scenario)

### Test 10.3: Stress Test - Circuit Breaker Engagement

**Objective:** Verify system stability during stress conditions

**Precondition:** Run during the announced 24-hour circuit breaker testing window — see Category 6 for details.

**User Actions:**
1. Create multiple active deployments (2-3):
   ```bash
   akash tx bme mint-act 300000000uakt --from <wallet> -y
   sleep 60
   akash tx deployment create deploy-1.yml --deposit 50000000uact --from <wallet> -y
   # Complete lease...
   akash tx deployment create deploy-2.yml --deposit 50000000uact --from <wallet> -y
   # Complete lease...
   ```

2. Verify all deployments running:
   ```bash
   akash query market lease list --owner <wallet>
   ```

3. Wait for price to drop toward halt threshold during the testing window

4. Monitor status transitions:
   ```bash
   # Run periodically
   akash query bme status
   ```
   Observe: Healthy → Warning → HaltCR

5. When HaltCR triggered, verify:
   - Existing deployments continue:
     ```bash
     akash query market lease list --owner <wallet>
     ```
   - New mints blocked:
     ```bash
     akash tx bme mint-act 10000000uakt --from <wallet> -y
     # Expected: FAIL
     ```
   - Burns still work (if you have ACT):
     ```bash
     akash tx bme burn-act 10000000uact --from <wallet> -y
     # Expected: SUCCESS
     ```

6. Wait for price to recover above thresholds

7. Verify system resumes:
   ```bash
   akash query bme status
   # Expected: mint_status_healthy
   
   akash tx bme mint-act 10000000uakt --from <wallet> -y
   # Expected: SUCCESS
   ```

8. Close all deployments:
   ```bash
   akash tx deployment close --dseq <dseq-1> --from <wallet> -y
   akash tx deployment close --dseq <dseq-2> --from <wallet> -y
   ```

**Expected Results:**
- Graceful degradation as Collateralization Ratio drops
- Mint status transitions logged correctly
- Existing deployments unaffected during halt
- No data loss or corruption
- Clean recovery when Collateralization Ratio improves
- All deployments can be closed normally

**Proof to Submit:**
- BME status at each state (Healthy → Warning → HaltCR → Recovery)
- Lease list showing deployments continued during halt
- Failed mint-act error during halt
- Successful mint-act after recovery
- All deployment close tx hashes

### Test 10.4: Multi-User Concurrent Activity

**Objective:** Verify system handles realistic multi-user load

**User Actions:**
1. Create multiple test wallets (5-10):
   ```bash
   for i in {1..5}; do
     akash keys add test-user-$i
   done
   ```

2. Fund each wallet from faucet

3. Each wallet creates deployments:
   ```bash
   # For each wallet:
   akash tx bme mint-act 100000000uakt --from test-user-$i -y
   sleep 60
   akash tx deployment create deploy.yml --deposit 25000000uact --from test-user-$i -y
   # Complete lease creation...
   ```

4. Let all deployments run concurrently (15-30 minutes)

5. Monitor vault-state during concurrent activity:
   ```bash
   akash query bme vault-state
   ```

6. Randomly close deployments over time:
   ```bash
   akash tx deployment close --dseq <dseq> --from test-user-3 -y
   # ... close others at intervals
   ```

7. Verify all accounting correct:
   ```bash
   # Check each wallet
   for i in {1..5}; do
     echo "=== User $i ==="
     akash query bank balances $(akash keys show test-user-$i -a)
   done
   
   # Check final vault state
   akash query bme vault-state
   ```

**Expected Results:**
- All operations succeed without errors
- No cross-user contamination (each user's balances independent)
- BME vault-state accurate across all users
- RemintCredits properly shared/consumed
- No deadlocks or race conditions
- System scales with concurrent users

**Proof to Submit:**
- List of test wallet addresses
- Final balances for each wallet
- Final vault-state
- Summary confirming no cross-user issues
