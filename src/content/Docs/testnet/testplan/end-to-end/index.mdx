### Test 9.1: Full Deployment Lifecycle - Happy Path

**Objective:** Complete end-to-end test of typical user journey

**User Actions:**
1. Create new wallet
2. Fund with 2000 AKT from faucet
3. Record all initial BME state
4. Create deployment (500 AKT deposit)
5. Verify deployment running
6. Top up deployment (200 AKT)
7. Let deployment run for 1 hour
8. Query provider payments occurred
9. Close deployment
10. Verify refund received
11. Reconcile all accounting

**Expected Results:**
- All steps complete successfully
- RemintCredits accrued on deposits
- RemintCredits used on settlements/refund
- TotalMinted unchanged (if no price drop)
- Final AKT balance = Initial - compute_used (at varying prices)
- All ledger records present and accurate

### Test 9.2: Full Lifecycle with Price Volatility

**Objective:** End-to-end test with price movements

**User Actions:**
1. Create deployment at P = $1.00
2. Let run, price rises to $1.50 (settlement at high price)
3. Price drops to $0.80
4. Close deployment (refund at low price)
5. Reconcile all accounting

**Expected Results:**
- Settlements during high price: fewer AKT paid, remint credits surplus
- Refund during low price: may require new minting if surplus insufficient
- TotalMinted reflects any inflationary events
- User's final AKT reflects USD exposure, not AKT exposure

### Test 9.3: Stress Test - Circuit Breaker Engagement

**Objective:** Verify system stability during stress

**User Actions:**
1. Create multiple active deployments
2. **[Testnet Admin] Gradually drop price toward halt threshold**
3. Observe:
   - Mint status transitions
   - Epoch timing changes
   - Settlement behavior
4. Trigger HaltCR
5. Verify existing deployments continue
6. Verify new deployments blocked
7. **[Testnet Admin] Recover price**
8. Verify system resumes

**Expected Results:**
- Graceful degradation as Collateralization Ratio drops
- No data loss or corruption
- Clean recovery when Collateralization Ratio improves

### Test 9.4: Multi-User Concurrent Activity

**Objective:** Verify system handles realistic multi-user load

**User Actions:**
1. Create 10 test wallets
2. Fund each with AKT
3. Each wallet creates 2-3 deployments
4. Let all run concurrently
5. Randomly close deployments over time
6. Verify all accounting correct

**Expected Results:**
- All operations succeed
- No cross-user contamination
- BME state accurate across all users
- RemintCredits properly shared/consumed
