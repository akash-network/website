These tests verify that BME operations emit proper events that can be observed in transaction logs.

**Available BME query commands:**
- `akash query bme params`
- `akash query bme status`
- `akash query bme vault-state`

**Viewing Transaction Events:**
```bash
# Query transaction by hash to see events
akash query tx <tx-hash> --output json | jq '.events'

# Filter for BME-related events
akash query tx <tx-hash> --output json | jq '.events[] | select(.type | contains("bme"))'
```

### Test 8.1: Event Emission - MintACT

**Objective:** Verify events are emitted when minting ACT

**User Actions:**
1. Execute mint operation:
   ```bash
   akash tx bme mint-act 20000000uakt --from <wallet> -y
   ```
   Note the transaction hash from output.

2. Query transaction events:
   ```bash
   akash query tx <tx-hash> --output json | jq '.events'
   ```

3. Look for BME mint events in the output

**Expected Results:**
- Event emitted with type containing "mint" or "MintACT"
- Event contains:
  - `sender`: User address
  - `amount`: AKT amount minted
  - Additional fields: oracle price, ACT amount

**Proof to Submit:**
- Transaction hash
- Event output showing mint event with correct fields

### Test 8.2: Event Emission - BurnACT

**Objective:** Verify events are emitted when burning ACT

**User Actions:**
1. Ensure wallet has ACT balance (from previous minting)

2. Execute burn operation:
   ```bash
   akash tx bme burn-act 15000000uact --from <wallet> -y
   ```
   Note the transaction hash from output.

3. Query transaction events:
   ```bash
   akash query tx <tx-hash> --output json | jq '.events'
   ```

4. Look for BME burn events in the output

**Expected Results:**
- Event emitted with type containing "burn" or "BurnACT"
- Event contains:
  - `sender`: User address
  - `amount`: ACT amount burned
  - Additional fields: AKT received, oracle price

**Proof to Submit:**
- Transaction hash
- Event output showing burn event with correct fields

### Test 8.3: Event Emission - Settlement

**Objective:** Verify settlement events are emitted during deployment lifecycle

**User Actions:**
1. Create a deployment (see Category 1 for full workflow):
   ```bash
   akash tx bme mint-act 100000000uakt --from <wallet> -y
   sleep 60
   akash tx deployment create deploy.yml --deposit 50000000uact --from <wallet> -y
   # Complete lease creation...
   ```

2. Let deployment run for at least one settlement epoch (~1-2 minutes)

3. Close deployment and capture transaction hash:
   ```bash
   akash tx deployment close --dseq <dseq> --from <wallet> -y
   ```
   Note the transaction hash.

4. Query close transaction events:
   ```bash
   akash query tx <tx-hash> --output json | jq '.events'
   ```

**Expected Results:**
- Settlement/escrow events emitted during deployment lifecycle
- Close transaction includes escrow/settlement events
- Events contain:
  - Provider address
  - ACT amount settled
  - Related deployment/lease identifiers

**Proof to Submit:**
- Transaction hash for deployment close
- Event output showing settlement-related events

**⚠️ Important:** Close deployment when testing is complete.
