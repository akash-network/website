**Understanding Epoch-Based Processing:**

The BME module processes mint/burn requests in epochs (batches of ~10 blocks / ~1 minute), not immediately. There is no CLI command to directly view pending operations waiting in the queue.

**However, pending operations can be inferred from vault-state:**
- **Pending mints:** When you mint ACT, `balances.uakt` increases immediately (AKT received by vault), but `remint_credits` only updates after the epoch completes. The difference indicates pending mints.
- **Pending burns:** Similar pattern — ACT is received but AKT isn't released until epoch processes.

**To detect pending operations:**
```bash
# Check vault state
akash query bme vault-state

# If balances.uakt > remint_credits, there are pending mint operations
# The difference = amount of AKT awaiting ACT minting
```

Tests in this category verify epoch behavior through vault-state and bank balance changes before and after waiting for epoch completion.

**Available BME query commands:**
- `akash query bme params`
- `akash query bme status`
- `akash query bme vault-state`

### Test 4.1: Verify Request Queuing

**Objective:** Confirm mint requests are processed in epochs, not immediately

**User Actions:**
1. Record initial vault-state:
   ```bash
   akash query bme vault-state
   ```

2. Submit mint-act request:
   ```bash
   akash tx bme mint-act 100000000uakt --from <wallet> -y
   ```

3. Immediately query vault-state again (within 10 seconds):
   ```bash
   akash query bme vault-state
   ```
   Note: AKT should be in vault (`balances.uakt` ↑), but `remint_credits` may not yet be updated

4. Wait for epoch (~1 minute / 10 blocks):
   ```bash
   sleep 60
   ```

5. Query vault-state again and bank balance:
   ```bash
   akash query bme vault-state
   akash query bank balances <wallet>
   ```

**Expected Results:**

| Metric | Initial | Immediately After | After Epoch |
|--------|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| `balances.uakt` | X | X + 100M (immediate) | X + 100M |
| `remint_credits` | X | X (unchanged) | X + 100M (caught up) |
| `balances.uact` | Y | Y (unchanged) | Y + (100M × price) |
| `total_minted.uact` | Y | Y (unchanged) | Y + (100M × price) |
| User ACT balance | 0 | 0 | Shows ACT |

**Key Insight:**
- `balances.uakt > remint_credits` indicates pending operations
- Difference equals the AKT amount awaiting epoch processing
- After epoch: `remint_credits` catches up to `balances.uakt`

### Test 4.2: Multiple Queued Requests

**Objective:** Verify multiple requests submitted before epoch are all processed

**User Actions:**
1. Record initial state:
   ```bash
   akash query bme vault-state
   akash query bank balances <wallet>
   ```

2. Submit multiple mint-act requests in rapid succession:
   ```bash
   akash tx bme mint-act 50000000uakt --from <wallet> -y
   akash tx bme mint-act 50000000uakt --from <wallet> -y
   akash tx bme mint-act 50000000uakt --from <wallet> -y
   ```

3. Wait for epoch processing (~1 minute):
   ```bash
   sleep 60
   ```

4. Verify all requests processed:
   ```bash
   akash query bme vault-state
   akash query bank balances <wallet>
   ```

**Expected Results:**
- All AKT transfers to vault complete (150 AKT total)
- After epoch: Total ACT minted reflects all three requests
- User ACT balance = 150 AKT × oracle_price
- Final state is consistent (no lost requests)

### Test 4.3: Queue Behavior During Circuit Breaker

**Objective:** Verify mint requests fail when circuit breaker is active

**Precondition:** Circuit breaker states must be initiated by Akash Core team. Coordinate with the team before running this test.

**User Actions:**
1. Verify circuit breaker is active:
   ```bash
   akash query bme status
   ```
   Confirm: `status: mint_status_halt_cr` and `mints_allowed: false`

2. Record vault state before:
   ```bash
   akash query bme vault-state
   ```

3. Attempt to mint ACT:
   ```bash
   akash tx bme mint-act 100000000uakt --from <wallet> -y
   ```

4. Observe result and check vault state:
   ```bash
   akash query bme vault-state
   ```

**Expected Results:**
- Transaction fails with circuit breaker error
- No AKT transferred to vault
- Vault state unchanged
- `refunds_allowed` should still be `true` (users can exit via burn-act)

**Note:** This confirms that during circuit breaker halt:
- New ACT minting is blocked
- Existing ACT can still be burned (providers/users can exit positions)
