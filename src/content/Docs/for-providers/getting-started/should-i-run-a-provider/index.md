**Akash providers earn revenue by offering compute resources to the decentralized cloud marketplace. But is it right for you?**

This guide helps you evaluate if running a provider makes sense for your situation.

---

## What is an Akash Provider?

Akash Network is a decentralized cloud marketplace where users can lease compute resources in a permissionless and open environment. As an Akash provider, you contribute your compute resources to the network and earn revenue by hosting workloads for tenants.

Providers can offer:
- **CPU/Memory/Storage** - Standard compute resources
- **GPUs** - High-demand resources for AI/ML and rendering
- **Persistent Storage** - Data that survives restarts
- **Static IPs** - Dedicated IP addressing

---

## Benefits of Running a Provider

### 💰 Revenue Opportunities
- Earn AKT tokens for hosting workloads
- Set your own pricing
- Higher demand for GPU resources
- Persistent storage premium pricing
- 24/7 passive income potential

### 🌍 Support Decentralization
- Help build the decentralized cloud
- Reduce dependence on centralized providers
- Support censorship-resistant infrastructure
- Join a global network of providers

### 📈 Flexible Scaling
- Start small, scale as you grow
- Add resources incrementally
- Control what workloads you accept
- Adjust pricing based on demand

---

## Requirements & Considerations

### ✅ You're a Good Fit If You Have:

**Technical Skills:**
- Linux system administration experience
- Kubernetes knowledge (or willingness to learn)
- Basic networking understanding
- Command-line comfort

**Resources:**
- Spare compute capacity (physical or cloud)
- Static IP address or dynamic DNS
- Reliable internet connection (100+ Mbps)
- Time for initial setup (4-8 hours)
- Time for maintenance (2-4 hours/week)

**Financial:**
- Minimum 5 AKT for initial deposit
- Ability to cover electricity/hosting costs
- Capital for hardware (if needed)

### ❌ You Might Want to Reconsider If:

- No Kubernetes experience and not interested in learning
- Unreliable internet connection
- Can't commit time for maintenance
- Hardware doesn't meet minimum requirements
- Expecting immediate profit (ROI takes time)

## Setup Options

There are three ways to set up an Akash provider:

### 1. Provider Playbook (Recommended for Most)
**Best for:** Those who want automated setup

- Uses Ansible playbooks for automation
- Standardized, repeatable process
- Handles Kubernetes + Provider setup
- Less room for error
- **Time:** 2-4 hours

### 2. Manual CLI Setup
**Best for:** Advanced users who want full control

- Complete control over configuration
- Good for custom setups
- Requires more Kubernetes knowledge
- More flexibility
- **Time:** 4-8 hours

### 3. Provider Console
**Best for:** Quick testing and evaluation

- Web-based interface
- Easiest to get started
- Less customization
- Great for learning
- **Time:** 1-2 hours

---

## Cost Considerations

### Initial Costs
- **Hardware:** $500-$5,000+ (or existing hardware)
- **AKT Tokens:** 5+ AKT for deposits (~$10-50 depending on market)
- **Setup Time:** Your time investment

### Ongoing Costs
- **Electricity:** $20-200+/month (depending on hardware)
- **Internet:** $50-100/month (business connection recommended)
- **Maintenance:** 2-4 hours/week of your time

### Revenue Potential
- **CPU/Memory:** $10-100+/month (highly variable)
- **GPUs:** $100-1,000+/month (high demand)
- **Persistent Storage:** $10-50+/month
- **Note:** Revenue depends on capacity, uptime, pricing, and market demand

---

## Time Investment

### Initial Setup
- **Provider Playbook:** 2-4 hours
- **Manual CLI:** 4-8 hours (first time)
- **Provider Console:** 1-2 hours

### Ongoing Maintenance
- **Monitoring:** 30 min/day
- **Updates:** 1-2 hours/month
- **Troubleshooting:** Variable (2-4 hours/week average)
