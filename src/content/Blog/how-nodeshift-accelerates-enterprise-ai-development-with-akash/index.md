Akash Network provides cost-effective, secure, decentralized cloud computing at scale. When NodeShift, a streamlined AI model and agent deployment platform, needed reliable customer GPU access, Akash’s GPU marketplace emerged as an ideal solution. This case study examines how NodeShift leveraged Akash GPUs to simplify AI deployment and LLM training without requiring users to navigate blockchain complexities.

## Building a Platform for Enterprise AI
NodeShift sought a scalable GPU provider to support enterprise AI workloads, including LLMs and AI Agents, requiring powerful GPUs like NVIDIA’s A100, H100, and H200. Traditional cloud solutions often involve lengthy procurement processes, high costs, and inflexible deployments. NodeShift needed a solution that would reduce barriers to adoption and streamline resource allocation while maintaining enterprise-grade security and reliability.

## Choosing the Akash Supercloud
Akash Network's decentralized GPU marketplace provided several enterprise-focused advantages. Customers gained access to high-density NVIDIA GPUs, which are essential for demanding AI tasks. Additionally, Akash enabled instant scalability through on-demand provisioning, eliminating traditional procurement delays. The marketplace also offered transparent and competitive pricing, significantly reducing enterprise expenses.
