> A community of trusted contributors supporting the Akash Network across development, education, and adoption.

Since its launch in late 2021, the Akash Insiders program has grown into a quietly powerful force within the decentralized infrastructure and AI ecosystems.

What began as an experiment is now a global movement — a growing network of contributors who don't just support Akash, but actively shape it.

## How It Started

In my first few weeks at Overclock Labs, I conducted a deep audit of the Akash community. The results were unmistakable: the network already had builders, educators, organizers, and advocates.

This wasn't a community waiting to be formed — it was already in motion.

So instead of inventing something new, we created a structure to amplify what already existed. In collaboration with core contributors, the Akash Insiders program was launched. And what followed was a wave of contributions — technical, educational, and cultural — that continue to shape the network's direction.

## What Is an Akash Insider?

Akash Insiders are independent builders and leaders who help expand and evolve the Akash Network.

They build APIs, ship integrations, host meetups, publish content, mentor new users, and provide hands-on support across every surface of the ecosystem.

If you've deployed using the AkashChat API, joined a local event in Berlin or Nairobi, or received a helpful answer on Discord — chances are, an Insider was involved.

Their work is visible. Their impact is measurable. And their presence is foundational.

## Built to Scale with the Network

As Akash has grown, so has the Insider program. What began as a contributor recognition system is now the foundation for four independent, community-led initiatives — each designed to match the evolving needs of the network.

**Navigators — Technical Onboarding & Integration**  
Navigators work directly with developers to help architect, onboard, and launch projects on Akash. They bring deep technical fluency and real-world deployment experience.

**Ringmasters — Events & Community Activation**  
Ringmasters design and host Akash meetups around the world. These aren't marketing events — they're grassroots, on-the-ground efforts to build local DePIN and AI communities.

**Alchemists — Education & Content**  
Alchemists create high-leverage educational resources: documentation, deployment guides, tutorials, walkthroughs, and more. They help make Akash more accessible to developers at every level.

**Vanguards — Community Moderation & Mentorship**  
Vanguards keep Akash's community spaces active and trustworthy. They moderate conversations, answer questions, and offer guidance to both new users and experienced builders.

## Why It Matters

The Akash Insiders program is more than a community initiative — it's a strategic engine for network growth.

It allows the protocol to scale not just technically, but socially and globally. It decentralizes support, education, and outreach. And it creates a pathway for contributors to become core operators within the ecosystem.

For Akash, the Insiders represent what's possible when you trust the network to build itself.
