*A year of growth and adoption for Akash in 2024 and the vision for 2025 and beyond*

---

This is the decade that will define the next century. Last year, we wrote about two competing forces: one in favor of slowing (or even reversing) progress and another stronger force pushing for accelerating progress. As 2024 unfolded, the world seemed to tip decisively toward acceleration. We see it manifested in open infrastructures, the push for abundant energy, and the belief that broader access to compute benefits all of society. Akash is positioned entirely for a world that demands acceleration.

Overclock Labs, the creators and largest contributors to Akash, has long championed a radically open approach to building permissionless infrastructure. This ethic is rooted in solid fundamentals, which genuinely matter when building for the future. 2024 was the year that tested and ultimately affirmed our open approach to development. From record-breaking network growth to strategic integrations, from expansions into new regions to steadily climbing adoption, every milestone was propelled by the same undercurrent — open collaboration that thrives in public.

Below, we’ll cover the achievements that defined this banner year and examine where they lead us next. Beyond the perpetual hype cycle that often pervades AI and crypto, there is tangible, foundational progress at work that keeps propelling Akash, both as a network and a community, onto an ever-broadening global stage.

Here is the story of this moment in time: how momentum gathered in favor of acceleration, the fundamentals that give Akash real staying power, and the road ahead through 2025 and beyond.

## A Year of Foundational Network Growth in 2024
2024 was a pivotal year for Akash, underpinned by soaring adoption and significant growth on nearly every key metric. These achievements further expanded an already thriving ecosystem, cementing Akash’s position as a reliable, cost-effective, and truly permissionless network for compute.

### Significant Growth in Network Metrics
Akash experienced a surge in usage throughout 2024, most vividly reflected by its order-of-magnitude increase in USD-denominated spend (including AKT and USDC spend in a single metric). On January 1st, 2024, the network registered approximately $1,299 in daily spend, which increased to $11,038 by December 31st, 2024, representing a **749% increase**.

The growing daily spend also increased the trajectory of cumulative network spending. By October 27th, 2024, Akash had surpassed $1 million in cumulative spend. As of this writing, that number has climbed to $1.62 million. This represents a **609% increase** in total network spending over the year, underscoring market demand for compute.

[Network data from Q3 2024](https://x.com/akashnet_/status/1845976505853071864) tells a story of evolving quality and quantity on Akash. Comparing Q3 2024 to Q3 2023, app deployments (leases) **grew by 1,729%**, while the average fee per lease **increased by 688%**. This signals that users are deploying more often and are willing to pay significantly higher fees for workloads that stay online longer and demand greater compute resources. Compared to Q2 2024, the average fee per lease **increased by 192%** — jumping from $6.42 to $18.75. This indicates that resource-intensive deployments drive revenue, an indicator that GPU-intensive workloads for AI and machine learning development are driving real growth for the Akash Supercloud.

Looking ahead to 2025, the momentum of network growth is poised to accelerate even further. The core team is rolling out new features to boost user acquisition and retention, reflecting the network’s commitment to meeting growing demand. These insights are derived from on-chain data indexed by [stats.akash.network](https://stats.akash.network), with verifiable transactions on [Mintscan](https://www.mintscan.io/akash).

## Accelerating the Supercloud Into 2025 and Beyond
The past year of growth has laid a foundation for significant expansion in the year ahead. The demand for compute is not slowing, but increasing by the day, as AI reaches a new scale at the frontier, which is followed closely by state-of-the-art open-source models. As the gap between the capabilities of open and closed-source models shrinks, the need for accessible, permissionless compute becomes increasingly vital for maintaining this momentum.

The transformative achievements of 2024 have positioned Akash Network at the forefront of decentralized compute, establishing a robust foundation for continued growth in 2025. As demand for compute accelerates, Akash's open marketplace model and commitment to permissionless access position the network as the leading permissionless cloud network.

### Expanding Network Capacity and Capabilities
Building on the significant growth in 2024, Akash is well-positioned to extend and increase its growth trajectory into 2025. The network's market-driven approach, which is currently holding steady at ~80% GPU utilization, has proven that decentralized infrastructure can meet market demand while maintaining competitive pricing. To this end, one of the primary goals for Akash in 2025 is to significantly increase supply on the network, particularly in high-performance NVIDIA GPUs. Sustained market demand and high utilization have proven that Akash can absorb a significantly larger resource supply. 

One key milestone will be the arrival of NVIDIA’s next-generation Blackwell architecture on Akash. This will ensure users worldwide can access the most advanced compute resources. Akash's readiness for next-generation hardware and proven ability to meet market demand.

Organic growth in network supply will be achieved, in part, by new providers joining the network. This will be further incentivized by continuing the Provider Incentives Pilot (PIP) program, which proved instrumental in scaling GPU capacity throughout 2024. New PIP plans will be included in the upcoming roadmap. These targeted incentive programs will bring new supply to the network on a much greater scale.

The successful introduction of credit card payments in late 2024 marked a turning point in making decentralized compute accessible to a broader audience. Building on this momentum, 2025 will see significant improvements the Akash Console, focusing on streamlining the deployment process and enhancing user experience. These improvements will make it easier than ever for developers and organizations to harness the power of decentralized compute, regardless of their blockchain experience.

These enhancements reflect a deeper understanding that the future of decentralized compute depends not only on technical capability but also on making that capability readily accessible. By streamlining complex workflows into intuitive interfaces, Akash removes the traditional barriers that have kept many organizations from embracing decentralized infrastructure.

### Increasing AI-Focused Development
As AI development increasingly shifts toward autonomous agents and specialized applications, Akash's permissionless architecture will become even more critical. As the AI agent frameworks develop, Akash's ability to manage and pay for deployments with AKT will become essential. The Akash Supercloud will aim to become the leading permissionless network for AI agent development.

This evolution enables entirely new categories of applications, from continuous-learning AI agents that require persistent compute access to distributed training pipelines that leverage compute resources across multiple regions. The network’s support for these advanced workflows, combined with its cost-effective pricing model, makes sophisticated AI development accessible to a broader range of developers and organizations in ways that are difficult, if not impossible, to achieve on traditional cloud providers today.

Akash's commitment to open-source development and transparent governance ensures that as AI capabilities expand, the platform will evolve in alignment with community needs. The upcoming detailed roadmap for 2025 and beyond will introduce new features and improvements designed to support increasingly sophisticated AI workloads while maintaining the network's core values of transparency, open development, and permissionlessness.

### Connecting the Decentralized AI Community
In the months ahead, the Akash core team and community will be opening a DeAI space in Austin, TX (collaborating with [Professor Sriram Vishwanath](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/sriram-vishwanath) from the University of Texas at Austin, and [Manifold Labs](https://www.manifold.inc/)) to bring decentralized AI builders together in a physical community space to share ideas, get access to compute, and more. The space was soft-launched in late 2024, and will officially open in the coming months. The DeAI space represents Akash's investment in fostering AI development through in-person collaboration, and will create a vibrant local ecosystem that bridges the digital and physical worlds.

The DeAI Space represents more than just a co-working environment, it's a practical demonstration of how decentralized communities can come together to collaborate.

### Collaboration With Academic Institutions and the Research Community
Academic collaboration remains a cornerstone of Akash's commitment to advancing the field of decentralized and permissionless compute. The collaboration with the University of Texas at Austin continues to explore new approaches to verifiable compute. At the same time, ongoing research initiatives drive progress in areas such as distributed AI training and edge computing optimization.

These research initiatives help validate Akash's approach to decentralized infrastructure while contributing to the broader academic discourse on the future of cloud computing. By bridging the gap between academic research and practical implementation, Akash ensures that theoretical advances in distributed systems and AI can quickly translate into real-world applications.

### Market Expansion and Adoption
Akash's growing institutional recognition throughout 2024, including attention from major research firms and traditional finance platforms, sets the stage for broader market adoption in 2025. As organizations increasingly seek alternatives to centralized cloud providers, Akash's proven track record of reliability and performance positions it as a compelling option.

The platform's support for traditional payment methods and non-custodial wallet transactions removes barriers to entry for organizations looking to experiment and scale with decentralized infrastructure. This hybrid approach, combined with competitive pricing and permissionless access, makes Akash an increasingly attractive option for organizations of all sizes.

### Building for Sustainable Growth
Looking ahead to 2025 and beyond, the focus for Akash remains on building sustainable, long-term value for its community and the larger permissionless compute space. The network's open-source foundation and commitment to transparent development provide a robust framework for continued advancement. By maintaining this commitment while expanding capabilities and improving accessibility, Akash can lead the next evolution of cloud computing.

The combination of expanding infrastructure capabilities, enhanced user experience, and strong community engagement creates a robust foundation for growth. As demand for AI compute continues to rise and organizations seek more flexible, cost-effective infrastructure solutions, Akash's decentralized marketplace model becomes increasingly relevant.

### The Path Forward Into 2025
The achievements of 2024 have demonstrated the viability and value of decentralized computing at scale. As we move into 2025, Akash stands ready to capitalize on this momentum, driving advancement in cloud infrastructure while maintaining its commitment to openness and transparency. With a clear 2025 roadmap for technical progress coming in the following weeks, strong community engagement through initiatives like the DeAI Space, and continued focus on user experience — Akash is poised to secure its postion as the leading network for permissionless compute in 2025 and beyond.
