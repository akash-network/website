Before contributing to the project, please adhere to the following guidelines to ensure the project's integrity and maintainability.

### File Naming Convention

When creating files for components, pages, etc., follow this straightforward file naming convention:

- **Component Name:** Utilize kebab-case, featuring lowercase words separated by hyphens.

  Example: `my-component-name.js`

### Commit Message Structure

Each commit message should carry a meaningful structure, commencing with a type and followed by a concise description. Utilize the following types for commit messages:

- **feat:** Introduce a new feature or functionality to the codebase.

  Example: `feat: implement user authentication`

- **fix:** Rectify a bug or address an issue within the code.

  Example: `fix: resolve issue with login page`

- **docs:** Focus on documentation-related changes, such as updating comments, README files, or documentation pages.

  Example: `docs: enhance installation instructions`

- **style:** Implement code style changes, such as formatting, indentation, or variable renaming.

  Example: `style: refactor CSS styles`

- **chore:** Undertake routine tasks, maintenance, or housekeeping activities, often not directly related to code changes.

  Example: `chore: update dependencies`

- **test:** Contribute to or modify tests, including unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests.

  Example: `test: add test cases for login feature`

- **perf:** Optimize the code for better performance.

  Example: `perf: enhance database query efficiency`

- **ci:** Implement changes to the continuous integration (CI) pipeline.

- **refactor:** Enhance code structure without introducing new features or fixing bugs.

  Example: `refactor: extract reusable function`

- **build:** Make changes related to the build process, such as build scripts or tools.

  Example: `build: update webpack configuration`

- **revert:** Revert a previous commit.

  Example: `revert: undo changes from commit abc123`

- **deps:** Update or modify project dependencies, such as npm packages or libraries.

  Example: `deps: upgrade lodash to version 4.0.0`

### Commit Message Best Practices

- Keep commit messages concise and to the point.
- Utilize the imperative mood (e.g., "add," "fix," "update") in the description.
- Provide context in the description when necessary..
